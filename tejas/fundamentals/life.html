                  <p class="text">Painting a picture of Caddo life requires us 
                    to try and freeze a moment in time as if we were there. For 
                    the scene above, the artist depicted a moment about 900 years 
                    ago at the height of one of the ancient Caddo sites archeologists 
                    know the most about. But what moment should we choose here, 
                    for a verbal sketch? Caddo life changed in countless ways 
                    throughout the Caddo Homeland over the long march of Caddo 
                    history. Therefore we need to employ anthropology's favorite 
                    descriptive device: the concept of the <strong>ethnographic present</strong>. 
                    We will try to describe what Caddo life was like about 400 
                    years ago, at the end of the 17th century (late 1600s), based 
                    mainly on the accounts of early Spanish and French observers. 
                    We choose this particular time as the ethnographic present 
                    because this is the earliest period for which we have detailed 
                    eyewitness descriptions as well as the latest period during 
                    which Caddo society was still intact and relatively unchanged 
                    by European contact. </p>
                  <p class="text">&quot;Relatively unchanged by European contact?&quot; 
                    Yes, compared to only a few years later when the invaders' 
                    epidemics, guns, and horses brought about swift and often 
                    terrible changes in Caddo life. The fact that the French saw 
                    peach orchards and watermelon patches at Caddo sites in the 
                    1680s shows that Caddo life had already changed as a consequence 
                    of the arrival in the New World of peoples and plants from 
                    the Old World brought by Spanish colonists. It is thought 
                    that the first epidemics of Old World diseases, to which New 
                    World peoples had no immunity, spread widely and cruelly across 
                    the densely settled Eastern Woodlands before Europeans ever 
                    visited most areas. During the succeeding centuries of European 
                    colonization, wave after wave of Old World diseases swept 
                    across native North America. It has been estimated that Caddo 
                    population may have fallen by as much as 95 percentage between 1691 
                    and 1816, a catastrophic change few human societies have survived. 
                    So we choose the late 17th century as our main window on Caddo 
                    life, mindful that the lives of generations before and after 
                    may have been quite different. </p>
                  <p class="text">Early Spanish and French accounts mainly describe 
                    the <strong>Hasinai </strong>groups living in the southwestern part 
                    of the Caddo Homeland in what is today east Texas. Far less 
                    is known about the <strong>Cadohadacho</strong>-allied groups and even 
                    less about others elsewhere in the Caddo Homeland. If we had 
                    comparable accounts for all Caddo groups, we would probably 
                    be struck by the differences across the Caddo world as much 
                    or more than the similarities. Some of these suspected (and 
                    known) differences relate to the environmental differences 
                    across the region, while others are cultural differences reflecting 
                    each group's own history and customs and the influence of 
                    their nearest and most influential non-Caddo neighbors. For 
                    instance, Caddo groups living along Red River below the Great 
                    Raft interacted with lower Mississippi Valley peoples living 
                    a day's canoe trip downstream. In contrast, Red River Caddos 
                    living upstream from the Great Bend near the western edge 
                    of the homeland traded with Arkansas Valley peoples as well 
                    as neighboring Plains tribes (with whom they sometimes fought). 
                    With these factors in mind, we will mention geographical variations 
                    glimpsed from available documents as well as make brief references 
                    to earlier and later periods to point out a few of the more 
                    important changes through time.</p>
                  <h3>Caddo Society </h3>
                  <p class="text">Like other aspects of Caddo life, Caddo society 
                    changed through time. During the historic era in particular, 
                    Caddo society was radically transformed by the chain of events 
                    initiated by the European invasion. Even before Europeans 
                    arrived, there is no reason at all to think that Caddo society 
                    was uniform across the Caddo Homeland at any point in time. 
                    Nonetheless, early Spanish visitors noticed more commonalities 
                    than differences among the Caddo groups they visited. They 
                    were struck by the highly organized and civilized society 
                    of the Caddo, especially in comparison to the smaller scale 
                    hunting and gathering groups they encountered elsewhere in 
                    Texas. Unlike some of the tribes living in fortified towns 
                    along the lower Mississippi and elsewhere in the Southeast 
                    with whom the Spanish had fought bloody battles, the Caddo 
                    lived in sprawling, unfortified communities.</p>
                  <p class="text"><strong>Caddo society was made up of independent 
                    named groups</strong> sometimes called tribes or nations by the 
                    early Europeans. Each was comprised of a principal community 
                    or village (groups were known by the name of the principal 
                    village) and various affiliated communities. The communities 
                    were made up of villages, hamlets, and farmsteads. Nearby 
                    villages and hamlets belonged to the same community. Typically 
                    the affiliated communities shared a section of a river valley 
                    and adjacent uplands and were within a day's walk from one 
                    another. The normal settlement pattern was dispersed (spread 
                    out), but nucleated (tightly clustered) villages and hamlets 
                    also existed. </p>
                  <p class="text">At the top of Caddo society were religious and 
                    political leaders who held inherited positions. These positions 
                    were normally held by men, but a few female leaders are known 
                    from historic accounts and in some high-status prehistoric 
                    tombs the principal individuals appear to have been women. 
                    Among the Hasinai groups, the <em><strong>xinesi</strong></em> (pronounced 
                    chenesi, meaning Mr. Moon) inherited the position of spiritual 
                    leadership (head priest) and served all of the allied communities. 
                    Each community had a <em><strong>caddi</strong></em> or principal headman 
                    (civil chief), a rank that was also inherited from father 
                    to son, as well as a group of village elders known as <em><strong>canahas</strong></em>. 
                    In consultation with the canahas, the caddi was primarily 
                    responsible for making the important political decisions for 
                    the community, sponsoring major ceremonies of a diplomatic 
                    nature, leading councils for war/raiding expeditions, and 
                    conducting the calumet (or peace pipe) ceremony with important 
                    visitors to the communities. The <em><strong>tammas</strong></em> were 
                    subordinate &quot;enforcers&quot; who made sure the caddi's 
                    decisions were obeyed and that people behaved properly. </p>
                  <p class="text">The Caddo people looked to the xinesi for mediation 
                    and communication with their principal god, the <em><strong>Caddi 
                    Ayo</strong></em>, for religious leadership and decision-making 
                    influence, and in leading certain special rites, including 
                    the first-fruit or green corn rituals, harvest, and naming 
                    ceremonies. In essence, the xinesi connected Caddo life to 
                    the supernatural realm. In return, community members provided 
                    for the xinesi's needs in terms of food and shelter. At a 
                    less exalted level, each community had various lesser priests 
                    as well as <em><strong>connas</strong></em> (medicine men) who cured sickness 
                    and carried out daily rituals. </p>
                  <p class="text"><strong>Caddo peoples traced descent through the 
                    maternal (mother's) line</strong>, as was still reflected by kinship 
                    terms recorded as late as the early 1900s. They also recognized 
                    clans, kinship groups that traced their heritage to a common 
                    ancestor through the female line. The clans were named after 
                    an animal (e.g., bison, bear, raccoon) or celestial phenomena 
                    (sun, thunder) and were ranked, some clans having a higher 
                    social status than others. Presumably the leaders were members 
                    of the highest ranked clans. Marriage typically occurred between 
                    members of different clans. Beyond these meager characterizations, 
                    the Caddo kinship system remains poorly understood in comparison 
                    to that of some tribes because many elements of it were drastically 
                    altered during the tumultuous historic period.</p>
                  <p class="text">The Caddo society described by Henri Joutel, 
                    Fray Casa&ntilde;as and other early observers in the late 
                    17th century was not all individualistic, it was<strong> communal</strong>, 
                    an integrated whole woven together and tightly bound by kinship, 
                    custom, and expectation. Each Caddo lived life according to 
                    the expectations and traditions of her/his community. The

                    of Caddo ancestors for at least a thousand years, probably 
                    much longer. Most accounts of Caddo life emphasize <strong>agriculture</strong> 
                    and rightly so because farming provided much of the dependable 
                    food supply upon which village life depended. The central 
                    role played by farming also helps explain why Caddo settlements 
                    characteristically were scattered and spread out&#151;the 
                    Caddo lived among their fields and gardens.</p>
                  <p class="text">In historic times, <strong>corn</strong> (also called 
                    maize) was the mainstay crop. The Caddo grew several varieties 
                    of corn including &quot;little&quot; corn that ripened in 
                    the summer and &quot;flour&quot; or &quot;great&quot; corn 
                    that ripened in the fall. Corn was dried on the cob and stored 
                    in raised granaries to keep it dry and protected from rodents. 
                    The Spanish noticed that the Caddo always saved their best 
                    corn for seed and hung the seed corn cobs high inside their 
                    houses where it would not be touched except for planting, 
                    no matter how little food was available. Corn also figured 
                    prominently in the annual ritual cycle with planting ceremonies, 
                    first-fruit or green corn ceremonies, and harvest rites. Successful 
                    fall harvests occasioned major festivals at the principal 
                    villages. These drew kinfolk and allies near and far for several-day 
                    celebration of Caddo life: feasting, tobacco-smoking, black-tea-drinking, 
                    dancing, trading, negotiating, courtship, and more.</p>
                  <p class="text">Other important crops included beans (five or 
                    six varieties according to Fray Casa&ntilde;as, the Spanish 
                    priest who lived among the Hasinai in 1691), squash, pumpkins, 
                    sunflowers, and various lesser-known domesticated plants including 
                    goosefoot (Chenopodium sp.). The Caddo quickly adopted crops 
                    introduced by the Europeans, including watermelon and peaches. 
                    Tobacco was another important crop required for ritual use. 
                    Women did most of the farming and all of the food preparation, 
                    although men did some heavy work such as clearing fields and 
                    helped at critical times such as harvest. Farming was also 
                    very much a communal activity. Fields were owned by the community 
                    and families were assigned specific plots by the tammas. Planting 
                    and harvesting were community projects that moved from plot 
                    to plot beginning with that of the xinesi and moving down 
                    the social ladder until each family plot had been reached.</p>
                  <p class="text">Wild plants, game, and fish were also vital 
                    food resources. Wild plants included nuts (hickory, walnut, 
                    acorn, and pecan), berries, plums, persimmon, grapes, and 
                    various seed plants, just to name a few. Throughout most of 
                    Caddo history, the favorite game animal hunted by Caddo men 
                    was the<strong> white-tailed deer</strong>. Deer provided most of the 
                    meat as well as hides, antlers, sinew, and bones for tools 
                    and clothing. Deer also figured prominently in Caddo dance 
                    and symbolism. Buffalo were hunted on extended trips west 
                    or northwest out onto the prairie-plains, but were not an 
                    important food source until after the late 17th century after 
                    the Caddo acquired horses. Turkeys, rabbits, and various other 
                    small animals and birds were hunted and snared. Caddo living 
                    along productive waters caught fish, turtles, and other aquatic 
                    species. Bear were hunted for food, fur, and especially for 
                    their fat, which served many useful purposes and was traded 
                    to the French.</p>
                  <p class="text">Three factors seem to underlie the long-term 
                    success of the Caddo economy: <strong>diverse natural resources, 
                    well-developed food processing and storage technologies, and 
                    the ready adoption of new crops</strong> from their neighbors and 
                    trading partners. Caddo peoples relied on many different wild 
                    and cultivated food resources, of which only a few have been 
                    mentioned. These changed in importance from place to place 
                    and with the seasons, the vagaries of rainfall, and through 
                    time. When crops failed, the Caddo turned to wild plant foods 
                    that had been used for generations. </p>
                  <p class="text">They had many ways of <strong>storing food</strong> to 
                    get them through the annual low point in resource availability: 
                    winter and early spring. They dried corn, beans, pumpkins, 
                    wild fruits, and deer meat. They smoked fish and other meats. 
                    They built raised and tightly sealed granaries to keep their 
                    corn supplies dry and vermin-free. Along the Red River west 
                    of the Great Bend, some Caddo groups used underground storage 
                    pits similar to those used by their Plains neighbors. From 
                    river cane and certain barks and grasses, Caddo women wove 
                    baskets and trays large and small, tight or loose; some for 
                    storage, others for winnowing and sieving. Out of clay they 
                    created all manner of ceramic cooking, storage, and serving 
                    containers. Bear fat, for instance, was rendered and stored 
                    in clay pots. Through such methods the Caddo survived thick 
                    times and thin.</p>
                  <p class="text">Agriculture was central to Caddo life when Caddo 
                    communities were first visited by Europeans, but this was not 
                    always the case. <strong>Early Caddo ancestors were hunters, gatherers, 
                    and fishers</strong>, living off the land. By 2,000 years ago, 
                    if not well before, ancestral Caddo groups began to cultivate 
                    the starchy and oily seeded plants that had been domesticated 
                    in the Eastern Woodlands by about 2000 B.C. We aren't certain 
                    when this happened because few plant remains of any sort have 
                    been recovered from the excavated Woodland sites in the Caddo 
                    Homeland. But there is little reason to doubt that native 
                    crops, including goosefoot, marsh elder, squash, and possibly 
                    sunflower, were adopted early on by the Caddo. </p>
                  <p class="text">At first these native seed plants would have 
                    been mere supplements to hunting and gathering, but along 
                    with gardening comes the requirement of returning to fixed 
                    places to plant, harvest, process, and store. The native seed 
                    crops were probably sown broadly in minimally cleared plots 
                    and allowed to compete with weeds. The real labor was in the 
                    harvest and processing; only the sunflower had compact durable 
                    seed heads. Goosefoot and marsh elder had small seeds and 
                    friable seed heads. All had to be carefully cleaned and separated 
                    from the stalks and chaff. These native seeds tasted bland 
                    and were probably prepared mainly in stews and gruels. Gradually, 
                    farming became more important, but was probably still secondary 
                    to hunting and gathering for centuries. Even though early 
                    farming must have provided only a small, labor-intensive part 
                    of the diet, the ability to produce this extra food and the 
                    requirement to stay nearby while it grew may have been the 
                    critical factors that led to increasingly settled village 
                    life.</p>
                  <p class="text">Later, we aren't sure exactly when, the Caddo 
                    adopted a tropical plant that had been domesticated in Mesoamerica 
                    and already adopted by farming peoples in the American Southwest: 
                    corn. <strong>Corn first appears at Caddo sites around A.D. 800</strong>, 
                    but may not have become a mainstay of the economies of most 
                    groups until after A.D. 1100. The reason for this lag is unknown, 
                    but a similar pattern occurred elsewhere in the Southeast, 
                    including the lower Mississippi valley. By 800 years ago (A.D. 
                    1200), the Caddo were big-time corn farmers who also grew 
                    squash/pumpkins, beans, sunflowers, and various other crops. 
                  </p>
                  <p class="text">Corn had to be planted seed by seed in individual 
                    holes and required greater effort to clear the land, keep 
                    it weeded, and fend off animals and birds. But the payoff 
                    came at harvest time when whole stalks could be broken off 
                    and gathered quickly, each containing one or two fat seed 
                    heads (cobs). (Corn was harvested stalks and all because the 
                    stalks were useful fuel for cooking fires.) Compared to the 
                    native seed crops, corn required minimal cleaning and processing 
                    and, once dried, could be readily stored without husking or 
                    stripping. </p>
                  <p class="text">Perhaps even more important was the fact that 
                    corn tasted sweet and flavorful, and it could be prepared 
                    in many more ways than the native crops: raw, parched, roasted, 
                    steamed, boiled, ground into flour, and more. Small wonder 
                    that <strong>corn became the economic lynchpin of Caddo life, celebrated 
                    in song and ritual, and symbolically linked to the sun</strong>, 
                    the giver of life. There was a downside; eating lots of corn 
                    caused a noticeable increase in caries (cavities). </p>
                  <p class="text"><strong>Trade </strong>was also an important part of the 
                    Caddo economy, at least in historic times. Caddo groups traded 
                    resources found within the Caddo Homeland among each other 
                    and to outside groups. The best-known Caddo trade goods were 
                    bois d'arc wood and salt. Salt was obtained in various places 
                    in the Caddo Homeland where saltwater springs or seeps were 
                    present. Caddo salt workers concentrated the salt brine by 
                    evaporation and boiling in heavy pottery pans and then traded 
                    the dried salt to groups elsewhere. For instance, in the spring 
                    of 1700, French explorers encountered Ouachita Caddos paddling 
                    canoes laden with salt along lower Red River, on their way 
                    to trade with Taensa peoples living along the Mississippi. 
                  </p>
                  <p class="text">Bois d'arc (Osage orange) bow wood blanks and 
                    finished bows from the Caddo Homeland were traded for hundreds 
                    of miles east and west. <strong>Bois d'arc is the best bow wood 
                    found east of the Rockies</strong> and the Cadohadacho groups may 
                    have had a monopoly on it. By late prehistoric times the natural 
                    range of bois d'arc apparently was restricted mainly to a 
                    small area along and south of Red River valley, just upstream 
                    from Texarkana. </p>
                  <p class="text">Bois d'arc does not grow well among other trees 
                    and evolved to rely on large herbivores like horses or mammoths 
                    to spread its seeds to open areas; most other species, including 
                    humans, find the horse apple, as its fruit is known, inedible. 
                    At the end of the last Ice Age about 12,000 years ago, horses 
                    and mammoths became extinct in North America, leaving the 
                    bois d'arc without a natural means of spreading. By the time 
                    Europeans arrived, the main remnant bois d'arc population 
                    grew within the western Caddo Homeland at the edge of the 
                    Blackland Prairie. The reintroduction of horses and Anglo-American 
                    farming practices allowed the bois d'arc to spread quickly 
                    over a wide area of the south-central U.S. Farmers planted 
                    bois d'arc along fence rows, were it is still principally 
                    found today.</p>
                  <p class="text">The role of the bow-wood trade in Caddo history 
                    has recently become the <strong>subject of debate</strong>. Arkansas 
                    archeologist Frank Schambach has put forth the intriguing 
                    argument that, prior to the historic period, the bow-wood 
                    trade was controlled by Mississippian traders (ancestral Tunica) 
                    from Spiro who established trading posts within the Caddo 
                    Homeland. The idea that foreign, non-Caddo intruders controlled 
                    enclaves within Caddo territory, such as the Sanders site 
                    on the Red River in Lamar County, has not been accepted by 
                    many Caddo scholars (nor by the Caddo Nation). For instance, 
                    the state archeologists of both Arkansas (Ann Early) and Oklahoma 
                    (Robert Brooks) have taken issue with Schambach's argument. 
                    This controversial interpretation and arguments pro and con 
                    will be the subject of a future exhibit on <em>Texas Beyond 
                    History</em>. </p>
                  <p class="text">Regardless of who controlled the bow-wood trade, 
                    <strong>trade may well have played a greater role in Caddo history 
                    than has been recognized</strong>. The Caddo Homeland is, after 
                    all, located between the Southeast and the Plains as well 
                    as the Southwest, three major culture areas and ecological 
                    zones with very different natural resources. Dried buffalo 
                    meat and buffalo hides from the Plains were traded widely 
                    in early historic times, as were salt, bow wood, and artifacts 
                    made of Gulf of Mexico shells from the Southeast, as well 
                    as cotton, turquoise, and shell artifacts from the Gulf of 
                    California from the Southwest. The spectacular wealth entombed 
                    in the Craig Mound at Spiro (about A.D. 1350-1450) is almost 
                    certainly a product of an earlier east-west trade system and 
                    there are many reasons to suspect that the Caddo groups to 
                    the south were also major players, particularly in the centuries 
                    following the demise of Spiro as a major center. In the early 
                    18th century, the French quickly enlisted the Caddo as trading 
                    partners to take advantage of their strategic position and 
                    established reputation as trustworthy middlemen.</p>
                  <h3>Caddo Ritual and Religion </h3>
                  <p class="text">In the late 17th century the Hasinai were said 
                    to believe in a supreme god called the <strong>Caddi Ayo</strong> or 
                    <em>Ayo-Caddi-Aymay</em>, sometimes translated as &quot;captain 
                    of the sky.&quot; The Caddi Ayo was believed to be the creator 
                    of all things and was held in great deference. The natural 
                    world of the Caddo was, however, inhabited by many other kinds 
                    of spirits including those personified by animals, places, 
                    and forces of nature. The Caddo followed many ritual practices 
                    in order to keep things right in their world. Matters religious 
                    were organized in a hierarchal fashion parallel to those that 
                    ordered society. </p>
                  <p class="text">The <strong>xinesi </strong>or head priest lived in a 
                    special precinct within the Hainai (chief Hasinai group) community 
                    or, after the early 1700s, in a separate place between the 
                    Neche and Hainai communities. Either way, the xinesi lived 
                    in a large grass-thatched house that stood near the fire temple, 
                    the principal Hasinai temple within which burned a perpetual 
                    fire fed by four logs, each oriented on a cardinal direction. 
                    Among the xinesi's chief responsibilities was keeping the 
                    fire going. There were apparently other, lesser fire temples 
                    among the Hainai groups, watched over by lesser priests or 
                    by the caddis. Similar temples were also described among the 
                    Cadohadacho and, archeological evidences suggests this was 
                    a widespread and old Caddo practice.</p>
                  <p class="text">The <strong>Hasinai fire temple</strong> was a very large 
                    structure that also served as a council house where important 
                    matters were decided. Nearby was one or two small houses where 
                    two divine boys (possibly twins) called the <em><strong>coninis&iacute;</strong></em> 
                    lived. These children served as intermediaries between the 
                    xinesi and the Caddi Ayo and were only visible to the xinesi, 
                    a circumstance that the Spanish priests ridiculed and cited 
                    as proof of the false nature of Caddo religion. Nonetheless, 
                    belief in the coninisi was widespread and they are may be 
                    analogous to the hero twins found in many other Native American 
                    religions. </p>
                  <p class="text">The xinesi was aided by other priests or shamans, 
                    some of whom carried out similar duties for individual communities 
                    and some of whom had specialized assignments. While most priests 
                    were men, there were apparently some women as well. The Spanish 
                    accounts are not clear on how the Caddo priesthood was organized, 
                    in part because priests on both sides saw the others, quite 
                    correctly, as dangerous competitors who challenged their own 
                    domains. </p>
                  <p class="text"><strong>Caddo life was seen as dependent on the proper 
                    performance of rituals small and large for continued success</strong>. 
                    There were proper and wrong ways of doing all things of substance. 
                    For instance, hunters sought a priest on the eve of a deer 
                    hunt to perform elaborate rituals involving the head and horns 
                    of a deer. If successful, the deer could not be butchered 
                    and eaten until a priest had whispered into its ear and taken 
                    the first share of meat. Similarly important rituals were 
                    associated with agriculture. Young and old women took part 
                    in a special spring ritual prior to planting to ensure good 
                    crops. There were also first fruit or green corn ceremonies 
                    and harvest ceremonies, each being the occasion for feasting 
                    as well as ritual.</p>
                  <p class="text">The <strong>connas</strong>, the Caddo medicine men or 
                    healers, were said to use herbs and various ritual practices 
                    such as smoking, sweating, incantations, and divination to 
                    cure sickness and heal the wounded. While the Spanish were 
                    distrustful of the medicine men, they also observed successful 
                    healing and realized that some of the herbal remedies were 
                    potent. Many of the curing ceremonies involved practices the 
                    Spanish associated with the devil. The Spanish priest Espinosa 
                    as translated by Bolton describes one such event. </p>
                  <blockquote> 
                    <p class="text"><em>To cure a patient they make a large fire 
                      [under the bed] and &quot;provide flutes and a feather fan. 
                      The instruments [palillos] are manufactured [sticks] with 
                      notches resembling a snake's rattle. This palillo [rasp] 
                      placed in a hollow bone upon a skin makes a noise nothing 
                      less than devilish. Before touching it they drink their 
                      herbs boiled and covered with much foam and begin to perform 
                      their dance without moving from one spot, accompanied by 
                      the music of Infierno, or song of the damned, for only in 
                      Inferno will the discordant gibberish which the quack sets 
                      up find its like. This ceremony lasts from midafternoon 
                      to nearly sunrise. The quack interpolates his song by applying 
                      his cruel medicaments.</em></p>
                  </blockquote>
                  <p class="text">It is unlikely that the medical practices of 
                    17th century Europe would be viewed by us today as any more 
                    sound or less superstitious than that of the 17th century 
                    Caddo. The Spanish and French witnessed and sometimes harshly 
                    described a Caddo society that had a complex and quite sophisticated 
                    set of beliefs and practices about the natural and supernatural 
                    world. It is only to be expected that the two worlds were 
                    foreign to one another and that neither side really understood 
                    the other.</p>
