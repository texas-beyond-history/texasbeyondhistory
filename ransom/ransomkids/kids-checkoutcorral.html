            <figcaption>Artist Frank Weir, left, examines the brand registry, while LeDell Bunton holds the piece of the actual branding iron belonging to Ransom Williams. Mr. Bunton is a descendant of former slaves who lived in nearby Antioch Colony and he may be a distant relative of Ransom Williams! <a href="images/kids-corral-weir.html" target="_blank" onMouseOver="MM_swapImage('Image17','','../images/camera-button-ro-sm.jpg',1)" onMouseOut="MM_swapImgRestore()" aria-label="Enlarge image"><img alt="Enlarge image" src="/images/camera-button-sm.jpg" name="Image17" width="19" height="20" border="0" align="absmiddle"></a></figcaption>

          <p style="padding-top: 15px;">The painting shown above is imaginary, but it is based on facts. The archeologists and historians working on the Ransom  Williams farmstead project uncovered a variety of evidence, and a lot of it had  to do with horses, rock walls, and water. Some of the evidence came from courthouses, where old records and maps are kept. Some came from surveying the 45-acre farm, making note of how the walls were laid out and where other features were located. Most of the evidence came from digging in the ground&#8212;all sorts of rusty bits of metal, horseshoes, nails, and other interesting-looking gear were uncovered during excavations. </p>
          <p>Armed with all this information,  the team sat down with artist Frank Weir to brainstorm ideas for how the corral  area might have looked more than 130 years ago and what activities took place there. Mr. Weir is an archeologist as well as a skilled painter, and he has a way of bringing the past to life! &nbsp;Let's check out the facts he used to create his painting. </p>
          <h3>Evidence  of a 19th-Century Horseman! </h3>
          <figure class="gallery-img gallery-img-third-size img-left">
            <a href="images/kids-corral-brand-registry.html" target="_blank"><img src="images/kids-brand-registry-new-sm.jpg" alt="Image of the brand registry that lists Ransom Williams name and the unique brand design" class="thumbimg"></a>
            <figcaption>This brand registry lists Ransom Williams' name and the unique brand design for his horses: the letters &quot;R&quot; and &quot;A&quot;. <a href="images/kids-corral-brand-registry.html" target="_blank" onMouseOver="MM_swapImage('Image18','','../images/camera-button-ro-sm.jpg',1)" onMouseOut="MM_swapImgRestore()" aria-label="Enlarge image"><img alt="Enlarge image" src="/images/camera-button-sm.jpg" name="Image18" width="19" height="20" border="0" align="absmiddle"></a></figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>We know Ransom Williams raised horses.&nbsp;Historians found  old&nbsp;tax records in the Hays and Travis County Courthouses showing he had paid  taxes  on  horses for several years. In 1871,  he paid taxes on nine horses worth $190! This was a lot of property, at a time when most African Americans owned only one or two horses or mules. </p>
          <p>Ransom Williams  also registered  his own  unique brand&#8212;a horse brand!&nbsp;The 1872 brand record, found in the Travis County  courthouse,  lists his name and a description of his brand: the letters &quot;R&quot; and &quot;A&quot;. By marking his horses with his special brand, Ransom could prove that they were his. </p>
          <p>Imagine the archeologists' surprise when one day, while excavating at the farm, they uncovered a  rusty piece of iron in the shape of the letter &quot;R&quot;!  It was part of the very same branding iron, just like the description in the  historic record! &nbsp;It was an amazing  piece of evidence to find! You could say it was &ldquo;the smoking gun,&rdquo; that proved  the historic brand register was correct. </p>

          <h3>Snaffle Bits, Spurs,  and Shoes</h3>
          <p>The archeologists also found a hodgepodge of metal artifacts that were identified as specialized gear for horses or mules. Based on the final artifact inventory, you could say that Ransom's horses had been well outfitted, indeed! There were 15 horseshoes, 33 horseshoe nails, nearly 50 harness buckles and rivets, several kinds of bridle bits, cinch rings for the saddle, and a harness cockeye. There was even several spurs for the horseback rider. Once attached to the back of your boot, spurs were used for kicking your horse while riding, to encourage a faster pace. </p>

          <p class="clear">There was also an assortment of wagon parts, also with funny-sounding names: brake locks and brake shoes, whiffletree clips, and clevises! For Ransom, these odd metal parts would have been important to keep in good working order. Without a good wagon, pulled by horses or mules, a man could not haul much in the way of supplies or transport it very far on foot. </p>
          <h3>Rock Walls and Corrals</h3>

          <p>If  Ransom Williams had horses, where did he keep them? The archeologists surveyed the entire farm and  found thousands of rocks stacked into long lines.&nbsp;These  walls&#8212;some as high as 3 feet&#8212;were once topped with barbed wire to make sturdy fences. The crew carefully  mapped what they saw and how it related to the landscape. They noted flat fields, hills, slopes, gullies, and depressions where water flowed and pooled after a rain. </p>
          <p>Once the map was completed, they could see that the rock walls in one area formed a rectangular enclosure.  It was next to a depression in the ground that  held run-off water from rains. It is very likely, the archeologists decided, that this was a corral, or pen, built to contain the horses, mules, or other livestock. The animals would have had access to  water from the pond. Many of the horse-related artifacts were found in this area. </p>

          <h3>Horses, Wagons, and a Way to Get Water </h3>

          </figure>
      <p>In the area of the corral, the archeologists also found dozens of iron strips they identified as barrel hoops. These came from large wooden barrels. While none of the wooden parts  remained, the team could infer (make an educated guess) that water barrels had been used in this area. </p>
      <p>Without a creek or other running water on the farm, Ransom and Sarah needed a dependable water source. The archeologists found no trace of a water well, or a windmill that would have pumped water from the ground. </p>
      <p>So how did the family get water? The best guess is that the horses or mules were put into service, hauling a wagon with all those barrels. The barrels could have been filled with water from the pond, when it was full, or filled with water from Bear Creek or one of the other creeks not too far from the farm. </p>
      <h3>What We've Learned</h3>

            <figcaption>Documenting the location of the barrel hoops, as well as all the artifacts, was an important part of the mapping project. <a href="images/kids-corral-barrel-hoops.html" target="_blank" onMouseOver="MM_swapImage('Image30','','../images/camera-button-ro-sm.jpg',1)" onMouseOut="MM_swapImgRestore()" aria-label="Enlarge image"><img alt="Enlarge image" src="/images/camera-button-sm.jpg" name="Image30" width="19" height="20" border="0" align="absmiddle"></a></figcaption>
          </figure>
      <p>Using bits and pieces of evidence, we have learned a lot about this part of the farm and about how Ransom Williams supported his family. Given the fact that he owned so many horses and so much horse gear, along with wagons and possibly carriages, we think he was in the business of raising or breeding horses or that he used his wagons to haul things for other people. </p>
