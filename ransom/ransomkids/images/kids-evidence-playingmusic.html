	  <p class="whatsstyle">Harmonicas and jaw harps were common musical instruments in the nineteenth century.  The jaw  harp, also known as the Jew's harp, mouth harp or juice harp, is  one of the oldest musical instruments in the world.  It originated in Asia, but versions of this instrument can be found in cultures all over the world.  This key-shaped instrument has a flexible reed attached to a rigid frame that the player puts in his/her mouth and plucks to make the sound.  Learning how to play it is not difficult once you get the hang of it. <img src="kids-right-arrow-sm.jpg" align="absmiddle"></p>
	  
<p class="whatsstyle"><img src="kids-left-arrow-sm.jpg" alt="">The harmonica, also known as the mouth organ and the French harp, was invented in Austria in the 1820's and brought to America by German immigrants.    By the 1860's, Matthias Hohner, a German clockmaker, had figured out a way to mass-produce harmonicas and started to develop different types.  The instrument, first intended for classical music, became popular in American folk and country music and jazz.    </p>    </td>

Experienced harmonica players can make natural sounds—barking dogs, meowing cats, mooing cows, and chirping birds—as well as crying babies!  They also can reproduce mechanical noises, such as the sounds of a train whistling, chugging, and clacking on the track.  </p>

	<p class="whatsstyle">Written around 1820, the  lyrics, or words, of this song may not make sense to us today and may have been intended to be degrading to African-American people. For that reason, a song writer wrote more uplifting words to go with the same tune.  As early as 1844, singers were performing "A Song for Emancipation" to the tune of Old Dan Tucker.  Called "Get Off the Track,"   the song is about the abolition of slavery.  It was written about 20 years before slaves were finally freed in the United States.  One of the verses goes like this:</p>
