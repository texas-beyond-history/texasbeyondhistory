      <p>In the summer of  1542, the several hundred people making up the Hernando De Soto expedition  entered what is today the northeast corner of Texas after travelling more than  three years across the southeastern U.S. De Soto had died a few months earlier,  and Luis de Moscoso Alvarado was their new leader. Here, they met the first of  several groups of Caddo and other Indians they would encounter before leaving  Texas on their way back to the Mississippi River. They called this first Caddo  group, who lived on the Red River near present-day Texarkana, Naguatex.</p>
      <p>After a few days,  they left the Red River and traveled south, probably on an ancient Indian trail  known as the Hasinai Trace. One of the few written accounts of this expedition  reports that:
      <ul><p><em>...after marching three days [they]  reached a town of four or five houses, belonging to the cacique of that  miserable province, called Nissohone. It was a poorly populated region and had  little maize. Two days later, the guides who were guiding the governor [de  Moscoso Alvarado], if they had to go toward the west, guided them toward the  east, and sometimes they went through dense forests, wandering off the road.  The governor ordered them hanged from a tree, and an Indian woman, who had been  captured at Nissohone, guided him, and he went back to look for the road. </em></p>
  </ul>
    <ul>
      <p><em>Two days later, he [de Moscoso Alvarado] reached  another wretched land called Lacane. There he captured an Indian who said that  the land of Nondacao was a very populous region and the houses are scattered  about one from another as is customary in mountains, and that there was an  abundance of maize. The cacique [of Nondacao] and his Indians came weeping like  those of Naguatex, that being their custom in token of obedience. He made him  [de Moscoso Alvarado, the governor] a gift of a great quantity of fish and offered  to do as he should order. He took his leave of him and gave him a guide to the  province of Soacatino.</em></p>
    </ul>
      <p>Archeologists and historians have  long thought that this group of Nondacao Caddo Indians lived somewhere in the  Piney Woods along the middle Sabine River, near the cities of Longview and  Marshall. The fact that a historic trail known as Trammel&rsquo;s Trace ran through  this area, following the old Hasinai Trace, is one reason for this. Another is  that Pedro Vial, a French pathfinder, passed through the middle Sabine basin  in 1788 when travelling from Santa Fe, New Mexico, to Natchitoches, Louisiana,  and recorded a group called the Nadaco as living there in a village of 13&ndash;15  houses scattered over a distance of 3 leagues, or about 9 miles. Because  Nondacao and Nadaco are historic variants of the same Caddo word, <em>Nadaakuh</em>,  (meaning &ldquo;the place of the bumblebee&rdquo; or the people of that place), there is  every reason to think that the people Pedro Vial met were the descendants of  those who gave Luis de Moscoso Alvarado a feast of fish 246 years earlier.</p>
      <h3>A Community Revealed </h3>
      <p>The latest chapter in this story  unfolded between 2004 and 2012, when excavations at an archeological site  called Pine Tree Mound (41HS15) recovered evidence that it was the political and social  heart of the Caddo province of Nadaco, starting in the 1300s and continuing  perhaps as late as the 1700s. This site, in what is today south-central  Harrison County, is large, covering an area of about 36 acres on a finger of  upland  north of where  Potters Creek flows onto the wide Sabine River floodplain. </p>
      <p>The archeological investigation,  conducted by Prewitt and Associates, Inc., of Austin, was necessary because the  site was in the path of a lignite mine. As a result of this work, the mine modified  their plan in order to avoid the core ceremonial area of the site, which the  project sponsor then purchased for preservation.&nbsp; Although the residential areas adjacent to  the ceremonial complex could not be avoided by the mine, investigations in those  areas&nbsp; provided important insights about  community structure and daily life.</p>
      <p>Archeological investigations  revealed that Pine Tree Mound was the site of more than a dozen residential household compounds ringing  a ceremonial precinct with three temple mounds. There priests and leaders, including  the <em>cacique</em>, performed the rituals that cemented the community together.  Archeologists know of no other site of the same age in this region that has  such a well-defined ceremonial landscape, and it is clear that this was home to  a powerful ruler. </p>
      <p>With the Hasinai Trace passing near  the Pine Tree Mound community and crossing Potters Creek just south of it, it is  inconceivable that this ruler and his people were unaware of the several  hundred Spaniards and Portuguese as they passed by in July 1542. We do not know  if this encounter, brief as it was, relates in any way to changes evident at  the Pine Tree Mound site starting in the latter half of the 1500s. It is easy  to imagine that it did, though, with that contact resulting in population loss  from introduced infectious diseases.</p>
      <p>The information archeologists  retrieved at Pine Tree Mound is exciting for what it tells us about the  prehistory and history of this part of northeast Texas. But the benefits exceed  those of many archeological projects in two ways. One is that this is a history  of a people we can connect to a living group of Native Americans, the Anadarko  Caddo, who make up part of the Caddo Nation of Oklahoma today. The other is  that, through the generosity of the project sponsors, the heart of this site is  now owned by the Archaeological Conservancy, an organization dedicated to  preserving some of the country&rsquo;s most important sites.</p>
      <h3><br>
        In This Exhibit</h3>
      <p>The following section, <strong><a href="investigations.html" target="_blank">Investigations: Uncovering a Caddo Community</a>,</strong> describes  the Pine Tree Mound site and details some of the key findings revealed through  excavations there. The next section, <strong><a href="ceramics.html" target="_blank">Ceramic Vessels of the Nadaco Caddo and  their Links to Mississippian Iconography</a></strong>, is in some ways the most exciting  part of the exhibit because it deals with subjects that sometimes get little  attention in archeology, but at the same time it is the most challenging to  understand because these subjects are complex. It deals with the decorations  the Nadaco Caddo put on their pottery and what those decorations tell us about  the symbols that were meaningful to them.</p>
      <p>In <strong><a href="nadaco.html" target="_blank">Pine Tree Mound and the World of the Nadaco Caddo</a></strong>, we look at how excavations at  this one site and analysis of information from other sites allowed  archeologists to form a picture of the Nadaco Caddo community as a whole and  how it related to its other Caddo neighbors. Some of what this section presents  is more speculation than provable fact, but it raises a host of questions that  can help guide future archeological research in this part of northeast Texas  for years to come.&nbsp;</p>
      <p> The final section, <strong><a href="credits.html" target="_blank">Credits and Sources</a></strong>, acknowledges the  people and organizations that played roles in bringing this project and this  exhibit to fruition and provides references and links for additional information. </p></td>
