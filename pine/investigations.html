      <p>The  investigations conducted at the Pine Tree Mound site were notable in several &nbsp;respects.&nbsp;  First, archeologists had the rare opportunity to conduct excavations  across the entire complex, including the ceremonial core and the surrounding village  areas. To accomplish this, an extensive program of testing, trenching, and  excavation was conducted over a period of several years.&nbsp; </p>
      <p>More than 3000 cultural features, including 3  mounds, perhaps 15 residential compounds, and 38 burials were documented, and  thousands of artifacts were recovered. More than 100 radiocarbon samples were  analyzed to establish a chronology of the settlement. With this rich body of  evidence, the Nadaco Caddo community  could be reconstructed and, as a result of the comprehensive evaluation, parts  of the site could be set aside and protected from future disturbance.</p>
      <h3> <a name="precinct"></a>The Ceremonial Precinct </h3>
      <p>The place to start  talking about the archeology of the Pine Tree Mound community is the area that  was the focus of ceremonial activities. This ceremonial precinct, which was the  center of the higher-level religious and political activities for the entire  community, encompasses some 14 acres. At its heart, and covering about half of  it, was the plaza, which apparently did not contain any substantial buildings. </p>
      <p>According  to Timothy Pauketat, an expert on the archeology of Mississippian peoples who  lived in the American Midwest and Southeast at the same time the Caddo were in  northeast Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, and Oklahoma, these central plazas&mdash;not the  surrounding earthen pyramids&mdash;&ldquo;were the anchoring features of these central  built landscapes,&rdquo; with &ldquo;plazas&hellip;often designed, engineered, and built at the  very inception of a Mississippian town.&rdquo; This probably was true at Pine Tree  Mound as well.</p>
      <p>The plaza at Pine Tree was bounded on the south, east, and  west by three  mounds, and on the north by a slope leading down  to  a spring-fed drainage (later dammed to make a stock pond). At its northwest corner was one or more burial  plots, or perhaps more likely a large cemetery, that probably was marked by  aboveground poles. The Caddo who lived at Pine Tree may have buried hundreds of  people here, including the highest-status members of the community. Radiocarbon  dates indicate that use of this cemetery began early in the history of the  ceremonial precinct, if not at the beginning.</p>
      <p>Over time in the  1400s and 1500s, the Caddo built ceremonial buildings and probably houses for  people who were responsible for the up-keep of these buildings and the  ceremonies conducted there between and around the mounds. From the archeological  work, we know there were at least seven such buildings. </p>
      <h3>The Mounds</h3>
       <p>The most conspicuous features visible at the Pine Tree Mound  site today, and when the Caddo lived there, are the earthen mounds, the  tallest of which stands nearly 8 ft (2.4 m) high. But the appearance of the site in modern times was dramatically different than in its prehistoric heyday. The open, grassy pastures were used for cattle ranching rather than gardening and village activities. A ranch house had been built on top of the largest mound in the  1960s, and a cattle feeder on one of the smaller mounds. Two barns,  livestock pens, and a second house also had been built in various parts of the  site. These modern buildings, since removed, were still standing during investigations, and archeologists conducted their work in the midst of them, with trenches running up to the edge of the ranch house. </p>
       <p>The largest mound, Mound&nbsp;A, was at the southern edge of  the open area interpreted as the plaza. It was  180 ft (55 m) long and 145  ft (45 m) wide and originally was about 10 ft (3 m) high. Archeologists placed a  large trench through Mound A and found it had only a few layers above the  natural ground surface and no evidence for buildings within it. Apparently, it  was constructed rapidly as a platform, probably to support one or more  important buildings such as temples, on its summit. The Caddo also may have had  ceremonial buildings on the spot before the mound was built.</p>
       <p>Mound C on the southeast edge of the plaza was similar to  Mound A in that it went up quickly and had a ceremonial building on its crest,  as well as one or more in that location before the mound was there. Mound C was  much smaller, though, just 90 ft (27 m) long,  108 ft (33 m) wide, and less than   3.5 ft (1 m) high.</p>
       <p>Mound&nbsp;B was on the west side of the plaza. At 120 ft (37 m)   long, 108 ft (33 m) wide, and 4 ft (1.2 m) high, it was a little  larger than Mound C, but it was different than the other two mounds in that it was  created through the construction, destruction, and capping of a sequence of  important buildings in this spot. Unlike at the other mounds, the builders&rsquo;  goal was not to create a platform on which buildings would sit. Instead, they  erected a building in a shallow depression dug into the ground, later destroyed  that building and covered it over with earth, and repeated that process several  times. Eventually, Mound B grew to the size it was when archeologists dug into  it in 2004, or actually a little larger, since erosion had removed part of its  top by then.&nbsp;</p>

The calibrated dates indicate that the Caddo started living here in the 1300s, when they built a few houses and set aside space in one particular part of the site for ceremonial activities that resulted in construction of at least one and probably two of the mounds.  <em><br>

    <td width="460" height="1129" valign="top"><p>The layout of some components of the ceremonial precinct likely  was guided by the cosmology of the people who worshipped here. Based on  analysis of the burials, archeologists concluded that the positions of the  sunrise and the stars Antares and Sirius were important to these people. The  fact that, when viewed from Mound&nbsp;A, the sun rises over Mound&nbsp;C at  the summer solstice in June indicates this, and the positions of Mound&nbsp;B  and the cemetery relative to Mound&nbsp;A mirror the northwest-southeast  orientation of the burials, which is perpendicular to the summer solstice  sunrise.</p>
      <h3> <a name="household"></a>Household Compounds</h3>
    <p>During testing, archeologists identified eight areas at Pine  Tree Mound that could have contained houses for the residents of the community.  They excavated three of these and decided that at least 15 household compounds&mdash;houses  and work areas&mdash;once surrounded the east, west, and south sides of the  ceremonial precinct. The excavations discovered posthole patterns that marked  wall posts for 38 circular structures or houses, averaging about 20.5  ft (6.3 m) in diameter. Constructed of a  circular framework of poles tied together at the top and covered over with bundles of grass  thatch, the houses would have resembled large beehives. Evidence  recovered from within the interior of the houses suggested areas where doorways may have been located, where smokey fires may have burned, and  where sleeping benches and storage areas may have lined the walls. </p>
    <p>Within the residential compounds, archeologists also found a  few rectangular patterns that may have &nbsp;been shelters for outdoor work areas or  elevated work platforms. &nbsp;In addition,  they uncovered many pit features resulting from outdoor activities in and  around the structures, along with much debris&mdash;such as broken stone tools,  flakes of stone left over from making tools, sherds from broken ceramic pots,  animal bones, burned corn cobs and pine cones, and wood charcoal&mdash;from the daily  lives of the people who lived there. </p>
      <p>Within each area, or compound, it appears that only one or two houses were standing at any one time. Each of these probably was home to a single family or two  related families, with six to ten people living there over spans of 100&ndash;200 years. </p>
      <p>Some houses were built, occupied for a time, and then  abandoned, while others were substantially rebuilt up to three times before  abandonment. Deterioration of construction materials, especially wall posts,  likely dictated when a house was rebuilt. This could explain some of the  variation in house size, for example, reuse of shorter recycled posts  necessitating smaller houses. </p>
      <p>Other factors such as changes in family size or status could  have been at play as well, but clearly the propensity to rebuild on or near the  same spot suggests the Caddo who occupied these places had a connection to the  land that persisted over many years. That is why the archeologists interpreted  them as multigenerational family compounds.</p></td>

      <p> The excavations  also uncovered two small cemeteries, one with 8 graves and the other with 13  graves, used by people living in family compounds nearby. In addition, several isolated burials were encountered in and near the houses. In all,  27 graves were excavated. Although most were single interments, one grave held  2 individuals and another also might have, although no bones were preserved to  prove this. Thus, these two families interred some 29 individuals, including  adult males and females as well as juveniles and adolescents. Radiocarbon dates  obtained from burned organic material scraped off pots found in the graves  indicate that both cemeteries date to the main occupation of the site in the  1400s&ndash;early 1500s. </p>
      <p>From the burial evidence, the investigators concluded that  the families associated with them were equivalent socially and that the  household compounds were functionally similar parts of an  integrated community. Most of the  graves contained offerings that  family members placed there to  accompany the deceased on their afterlife journey. Pottery vessels were the  main offerings. The average number of vessels was 7, but one grave had 27.  </p>
      <p>Other offerings included quivers of arrows (though only the stone tips had  survived), ground and polished stone tools called celts, smoking pipes made of  clay, finely fashioned ear spools made of stone, and a jumble of tools made of  bone and a stone hammer that was a kit for chipping tools out of stone. The Caddo also  placed red, green, and black mineral pigments&mdash;all colors that were important to  them&mdash;in some graves. Some  pigments were contained within the bowls of  pipes and pottery vessels. In several graves, these green pigment containers rested on the east wall, a placement likely carrying deep symbolic meaning. </p>

      <p>One of the pipes was found near the ear spools  and would have been to the right of the cranium. The stem of this pipe wraps up  around the bowl and is in the shape of a serpent&rsquo;s head. This pipe is the only  animal effigy discovered at the site. The numbers and kinds  of offerings indicate this individual was of high status and well connected in  the Pine Tree Mound community.</p></td>

    <td width="480"><p>Most of the offerings the archeologists found were of hard  materials that could not decay away, but they did find traces of some of the  many perishable offerings that must have been placed there. For example, there  were some stains in the soil that were left when woven reed mats placed in the  bottoms of graves disintegrated. These mats probably had been stained bright  colors and may have been adorned with bird feathers. One or two graves even had  soil stains showing that the deceased had been buried lying on litters of  wooden poles lashed together.</p>
      <p>The  graves contained 145 ceramic vessels of varied styles and shapes. These were analyzed to determine how the  Caddo used them, for example, whether some were cooking pots or serving bowls,  storage containers for foodstuffs or drink, or used in particular rituals. The  analyst also studied  the construction of the vessels to determine how the potters made them, what kinds  of materials they added to the clay to make pots stronger, and how they  finished the interiors and exteriors to make them more or less porous. This  information, as well as shapes and sizes of the vessels, helped determine  function. </p>
      <p>Decorations on the vessels, particularly those of the style known as Ripley Engraved, also  were studied. It is believed the decorations were applied not just for esthetic reasons  but also for symbolic purposes, conveying information about how the potters &nbsp;saw the world and their place in it. (See <u><a href="ceramics.html" target="_blank">Ceramic Vessels and Iconography</a></u> section for more detail.) What  sets the Ripley style apart from the other pottery types found (most of which  are in styles called Pease Brushed-Incised, Wilder Engraved, Harleton Applique,  and Maydelle Incised) is how the potters configured the various parts of the  engraved designs, which included scrolls, diamonds, circles, and crosses in  circles, to name a few.</p>

      <h3><a name="gardens"></a>Gardens, Fields, and Food</h3>
      <p>The Caddo word  &ldquo;Nadaakuh,&rdquo; from which Nadaco is derived, means &ldquo;the place of the bumblebee&rdquo; or  the people of that place, and this conjures up an image of a large open area  with lots of flowering plants. Bumblebees would have been great pollinators of  squash and other plants favored by Caddo gardeners. From the archeological  evidence, we know they grew maize, beans, squash, and gourds. Evidence of these  plants survived in pit features and smudge pits because they happened to be  burned. Smudge pots are small shallow pits with lots of charcoal. They probably held smoky fires used to control insects, prepare animal hides, or cook meals. They were found both inside and outside houses. </p>
      <p> The excavations also recovered maygrass, Chenopodium, little barley, and erect knotweed  seeds as well, indicating use of wild starchy-seeded annual plants. Other plant remains  found representing foods, or in some cases perhaps medicines, are sumac fruits,  waterlily or pondlily buds, American lotus seeds, Virginia creeper or grape  fruits, persimmon seeds, blackberry seeds, verbena nutlets, and bulbs that  could be from plants such as wild garlic or camas. The sumac remains may be  present because this plant commonly is a colonizer of old agricultural fields.</p>
      <p>The fields situated on the fertile lands around and between the house  compounds would have provided ample foodstuffs for the community year-round,  augmented by fish from the nearby creeks and game, especially white-tail deer,  hunted in areas away from the site. One feature of the landscape that was important to  both the Caddo and the people who ranched there until recently were natural  springs, since they provided abundant fresh water. There were at least seven  springs on the site, two of which contributed to the formation of drainages  that were natural boundaries for the ceremonial area and that, in modern times,  were dammed to create a stock pond and a small lake. </p>
      <h3>Pine Tree and Beyond </h3>
     <p>Although Pine Tree Mound was just one community within the  larger Caddo world, excavations indicate it was a very important site. This is where the community  leaders and the elite members lived and conducted the ceremonies and rituals  that bound the community together.</p>
      <p>By drawing on information from other investigated Caddo sites, we are able  to extend our view and address not only topics dealing with mundane aspects of  their daily lives&mdash;for example, how they built their houses and what kinds of  crops they grew&mdash;but also questions relating to the configuration of the  community as a whole.&nbsp; As a result, the  archeology of the Pine Tree Mound site provides new perspectives on the nature  of the Nadaco community&rsquo;s religious and cosmological beliefs and how those  beliefs may have connected them, socially and politically, to their neighbors. These topics are explored further in the following sections.</p></td>
