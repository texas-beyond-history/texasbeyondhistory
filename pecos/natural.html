                  <p class="text">Although the Lower Pecos Canyonlands 
                    occupies only a small part of Texas, its natural world is far from uniform. It is, in 
                    fact, a place marked by contrast: green and brown, canyon 
                    and upland, one river and the next, yesterday and today. This 
                    section introduces the natural world  through 
                    pictures and words. </p>
                  <h3><a name="land"></a>The Lay of the Land</h3>
                  <p class="text">The Lower Pecos Canyonlands lies at the southwestern 
                    edge of the Edwards Plateau&#151;the Texas Hill Country as 
                    most know it&#151;which in turn lies at the southern edge 
                    of the Great Plains. It also is within the northeastern edge 
                    of the Chihuahuan Desert. The area is located along 
                    the middle part of the Rio Grande drainage basin just below 
                    the S-shaped &quot;Big Bend&quot; where the river turns southward 
                    toward the Gulf of Mexico. It is there that the Rio Grande 
                    is joined by the last two major streams that feed its middle 
                    and lower stretches&#151;the Pecos River, and the Devils River. 
                    And it is the juncture of these three rivers that forms the 
                    core of the Lower Pecos Canyonlands. </p>
                  <p class="text">Within the region, the Rio Grande embankment 
                    is dissected by precipitous canyons and arroyos that enter 
                    the river on both sides. North of the Rio Grande, the land 
                    is level to hilly and is cut by numerous canyons. South of 
                    the Rio Grande lies an extensive plain broken by intermittent 
                    streams that originate in the Serranias de los Burros, a mountain 
                    range rising to almost 5,000 feet (1,524 meters). These mountains 
                    parallel the Sierra del Carmen of Mexico and the southern 
                    escarpment of the Edwards/Stockton Plateau. The southern part 
                    of the Burros are dominated by the 4,700-foot-tall Cerro Oso 
                    Blanco (White Bear Peak), which is located about 70 kilometers 
                    (43 miles) southwest of Del Rio. </p>
                  <p class="text">The deep canyons and porous limestone geological 
                    formations of the region give rise to numerous permanent or 
                    temporary streams and springs that stand in contrast to the 
                    xeric (desert-like) nature of the plains and plateau country 
                    that they dissect. The three permanent streams&#151;the Rio 
                    Grande, the Pecos River, and the Devils River&#151;are the 
                    life blood of the region, providing water and refuge to plants, 
                    animals, and people. The Pecos River enters the Rio Grande 
                    just 26 miles (42 kilometers) northwest of the confluence 
                    of the Rio Grande and the Devils River. All three major streams 
                    are joined by numerous small intermittent streams that form 
                    narrow side canyons and break up the surrounding topography 
                    into ridges, mesas, and fingers overlooking the deep green 
                    winding worlds of the rivers.</p>
                  <p class="text">The uplands and canyons  
                    really are two worlds that make one. Upon the uplands the 
                    horizon stretches forever, a jagged purple-blue line that 
                    slowly fades to black at dusk. Up on top, the wind sculpts 
                    squinting faces, sets ceniza and ocotillo branches to dancing, 
                    and fuels the rusty silver flash of a well-oiled windmill. 
                    There is no lasting natural reprieve from the relentless sun; 
                    the trees are small and dark clouds all too infrequent. In 
                    the best of times, the upland flats are grassy plains that 
                    once lured herds of buffalo down from the north. In the worst 
                    of times, there is nothing but thorn, rock, and dust.</p>
                  <p class="text">And down below, the twisting canyon tunnels 
                    form a closed-in world framed by white-rock walls and a blue 
                    sky high above. Sound, water, and critters travel thorough 
                    the canyon tunnels, seeking each other and the hidden green 
                    pools of water. The tenacious roots of sheltered trees try 
                    to hold the canyon floor together. But in time, each scene 
                    changes as canyons become half-choked with washed-in soil 
                    and the plant life that gladly follows, only to be scoured 
                    clean by a once-in-three-lifetimes deluge. The rockshelters 
                    provide only temporary refuge from the relentless cycles of 
                    the canyon world: night cool and day heat, drought and flood, 
                    bare rock and green plant. They, too, crumble with time.</p>
                  <p class="text"> Many large springs are located within and adjacent 
                    to the Lower Pecos Canyonlands due to its location at the southwestern 
                    edge of the Edwards Plateau. These springs occur mainly along 
                    the Balcones fault zone where underground rivers (aquifers) 
                    come in contact with impervious geological formations, forcing 
                    the water to escape to the surface under artesian pressure. 
                    Just east of the Lower Pecos Canyonlands, San Felipe Springs are 
                    the fourth largest springs in Texas and still serve as the 
                    sole source of water for the city of Del Rio. Goodenough Springs, 
                    also one of the largest springs in Texas, is located beneath 
                    the waters of Amistad Reservoir in a side canyon of the Rio 
                    Grande. Although surface water was confined to narrow canyons, 
                    numerous springs also existed on the plains to the south of 
                    the Rio Grande. The abundance of permanent streams and springs 
                    means that water was seldom a limiting factor to travel. </p>
                  <h3><a name="climate"></a>The Modern Climate</h3>
                  <p class="text">The southern and western edges of the Lower 
                    Pecos region receive an annual average of as little as 10 
                    inches of rainfall, while the northeastern edge averages almost 
                    19 inches per year, figures which place the area within a 
                    semi-arid climatic zone. Most precipitation occurs in two 
                    peaks, one in spring (April-May) and one in early fall (September-October), 
                    both fueled by thunderstorms at frontal boundaries fed by 
                    moisture from the Gulf of Mexico and sometimes the Pacific. 
                    The heaviest, drought-busting rains occur when tropical storms 
                    stall over the area, sometimes dumping devastating, canyon-scouring 
                    quantities of rain in a matter of hours or days. The driest 
                    months of the year occur in winter from November to March, 
                    and in summer from June to August. The frost-free period averages 
                    300 days between February 13 and December 8. The average annual 
                    temperature is 70&ordm;F, ranging from a low of 51&ordm;F 
                    in January to a high of 86&ordm;F in July.</p>
                  <p class="text">Although these averages give a general impression 
                    of climate, the truly interesting aspect of southwestern Texas 
                    climate is its variability. The Lower Pecos Canyonlands region is positioned 
                    at two great climatic crossroads of the North American continent&#151;along 
                    the sharp line between the humid east and the arid west, as 
                    well as the more ambiguous divide between the markedly seasonal 
                    regimes to the north and the winterless tropical climes to 
                    the south. Consequently, the region encompassing southern 
                    Texas and northeastern Mexico has a semiarid, subtropical 
                    climate with dry winters and hot summers. More critically, 
                    the climatic region containing the Lower Pecos has a greater 
                    degree of year-to-year rainfall variation than any other semiarid 
                    region in the world, except for northeastern Brazil. Rainfall 
                    is highly unpredictable and drier-than-normal years are much 
                    more common than extremely wet years. </p>
                  <p class="text">In short, the Lower Pecos Canyonlands lies within a climatically 
                    transitional region that can shift from a relatively well-watered 
                    green and grassy place to a dusty brown desert in a matter 
                    of years or even months. It is a marginal region for intensive 
                    land use&#151;plant and animal populations are quickly affected 
                    by fluctuations in precipitation. Throughout its history, 
                    humans have had to cope with climatic uncertainty, savoring 
                    the good months and years and suffering the many bad ones.

                  <h3><a name="veg"></a>Vegetation</h3>
                  <p class="text">Mirroring the terrain and climate, the Lower 
                    Pecos lies within a major transition zone where three great 
                    biotic provinces converge. To the southeast is the mesquite 
                    and thorn brush savannah of the South Texas Plains. To the 
                    north, the vegetation grades into the juniper-oak savannah 
                    associated with the Edwards Plateau, while Chihuahuan Desert 
                    Scrub covers the core area of the lower canyonlands of the 
                    Devils River, the Pecos River, and the Rio Grande and farther 
                    south.</p>
                  <p class="text">Overall, the Lower Pecos area is a savannah with 
                    a mix of grasses, brush, and trees. Depending on the local 
                    conditions, the area may favor shrubs or grasslands. The southeastern 
                    edge of the Lower Pecos Canyonlands  is part of the mesquite-acacia 
                    savannah of southern Texas. To the west, vegetation rapidly 
                    grades into sotol-lechuguilla-creosote bush vegetation typical 
                    of the Chihuahuan Desert. Despite the fact that the region 
                    is technically a savannah, woody plants dominate the vegetation 
                    in most upland areas within the boundaries of the reservoir 
                    today. These include mesquite (<em>Prosopis glandulosa</em>), 
                    several species of acacia (<em>Acacia</em> spp.), whitebrush 
                    (<em>Aloysia gratissima</em>), Texas persimmon (<em>Diospyros 
                    texana</em>), blue sage (<em>Salvia ballotiflora</em>), lotebush 
                    (<em>Ziziphus obtusifolia</em>), various buckthorns (<em>Condalia</em> 
                    spp.), and spiny hackberry (<em>Celtis pallida</em>). Creosote 
                    (<em>Larrea tridentata</em>) and ceniza (<em>Leucophyllum frutescens</em>) 
                    are prominent in many areas. Along the upper reaches of canyons, 
                    succulents and rosette-stemmed evergreens are also common, 
                    including prickly pear and tasajillo (<em>Opuntia</em> spp.), 
                    several yuccas (<em>Yucca</em> spp.), and <em>Agave lechuguilla</em>. 
                    Small trees are confined to narrow canyons or creek terraces. 
                    Littleleaf walnut (<em>Juglans microcarpa</em>), several species 
                    of oak (<em>Quercus</em> spp.), Mexican ash (<em>Fraxinus greggii</em>), 
                    and Texas persimmon (<em>Diospyros texana</em>) are a few of 
                    the more prominent tree resources located in the canyons. 
                    Large stands of Huisache (<em>Acacia farnesiana</em>) and mesquite 
                    (<em>Prosopis glandulosa</em>) occur on certain of the broad 
                    terraces in the eastern part of the region.</p>
                  <h3><a name="paleo"></a>Paleoenvironment</h3>
                  <p class="text">Despite the remarkable detail of the prehistoric 
                    vegetation record contained in numerous, well-preserved rockshelter 
                    deposits, only the general outline of the environmental history 
                    of the Lower Pecos is known well. It appears that the Chihuahuan 
                    Desert has expanded and contracted throughout the late Pleistocene 
                    (prior to 9,000 B.C.) and Holocene (or Recent) periods, leaving 
                    widespread relict populations of certain plants in favorable 
                    microenvironments such as the protected and relatively well-watered 
                    canyons. This is critical for two reasons. First, prehistoric 
                    peoples often relied on these relict or stranded populations 
                    of plants that are otherwise not commonly available in the 
                    area. Second, the mix of local and relict plant communities 
                    makes it difficult to reconstruct past environments because 
                    all but the most drastic vegetation changes are masked in 
                    the archeological deposits.</p>
                  <p class="text">The general climatic trends can be seen in the 
                    pollen record. As allergy sufferers know only too well, during 
                    certain times of the year certain plants release large amounts 
                    of pollen. Some of this pollen rain survives, especially in 
                    permanently wet places like swamps and in very dry places 
                    like the rockshelters of the Lower Pecos Canyonlands. By studying samples 
                    from deposits of known ages, pollen experts have reconstructed 
                    the paleoenvironment of the region at least in broad terms. 
                    Decreasing frequencies of pine pollen indicate that the region 
                    was slowly drying throughout the Holocene, with a brief wet 
                    interval occurring around 2,500 years ago marked by an increase 
                    in pine and grass pollen frequencies. </p>
                  <p class="text">While pollen provides a very general view of 
                    regional vegetation, most of what is known about Lower Pecos Canyonlands 
                    vegetation has been gleaned from the analysis of plant remains 
                    found in archeological deposits in the dry caves and rockshelters. 
                    The best known shelter in the Lower Pecos area is 
                    Hinds Cave which was excavated by archeologists from Texas 
                    A&amp;M in the 1970s. The Hinds Cave work showed that plants 
                    common in the Lower Pecos Canyonlands today, including lechuguilla (<em>Agave 
                    lechuguilla</em>), yuccas (<em>Yucca torreyi</em> and <em>Y. rostrata</em>), 
                    sotol (<em>Dasylirion texanum</em>), acacias (<em>Acacia greggii</em> 
                    and <em>A. rigidula</em>), prickly pear (<em>Opuntia phaeacantha</em>), 
                    shin oak (<em>Quercus pungens</em> var. <em>vaseyana</em>), mesquite 
                    (<em>Prosopis glandulosa</em>,) and juniper (<em>Juniperus</em> spp.), 
                    were well established in the Lower Pecos Canyonlands  by 7000 B.C.                  </p>

                          sotol plant are a common sight in the Lower Pecos Canyonlands. Sotol 
                          prefers thin rocky soils and steep terrain and often 
                          grows in great abundance in such areas. Prehistoric 
                          peoples harvested sotol hearts or &quot;cabezas&quot; 
                          (heads) in quantity and baked them in earth ovens. Photo
