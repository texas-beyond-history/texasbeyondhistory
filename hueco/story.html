    <td width="480" valign="top"><p align="left">For some 10,000 years, Hueco Tanks has attracted people who visited and camped around the rock hills, and left traces that archeologists can interpret.  The water sources, plants, and animals in and near the Tanks  made the area an oasis in the desert.  Evidence of many different groups that frequented the area has survived in the form of images drawn on the rocks, broken items  left behind, and stained soils in areas that were intensely occupied. Around 1,100 years ago the sandy land surface in this area stopped building up, so most of the discarded items, hearths, and house patterns left by people since that time remain on or near the modern ground surface. </p>

      <p align="left">The highly visible and shallow archeological record of Hueco Tanks is easily damaged by activities that erode the ground surface, and many have occurred there.  The Tanks were a stopping point on a western trail for several decades in the mid nineteenth century, and the center of an active cattle ranch for over 60 years.  The hills have been a recreation spot for  at least 100 years.   In 1939, artist Forrest Kirkland noted that "Flint flakes and pot sherds are plentiful throughout the entire area but artifacts [complete objects] of all kinds are extremely scarce now." A number of artifacts were carried away by visitors before property was  conveyed to the state of Texas  in 1969.&nbsp; The archeological and historic  record of Hueco Tanks State Park  and Historic Site is now protected by the Antiquities Code of Texas, and through  the Public Use Plan for the park.</p>

      <p align="left">Archeologists and historians have traced the human history of Hueco Tanks by looking at information visible on the ground surface and the rocks. A comprehensive study has been completed by Texas Parks and Wildlife  archeologists Margaret Howard, Logan McNatt, Tim Roberts, Amy Ringstaff, and historian  Terri Myers.&nbsp; They first sought information  through artifact styles, features, radiocarbon dating, and archival  research.&nbsp; Additional data on the rich  historic fabric of Hueco Tanks came from rock imagery styles, artifact  densities in shovel tests, and historic inscriptions.&nbsp; Together, these diverse information sources provide  a detailed record of the timing and location of human activities at this  special place.</p>
      <p>Although Hueco Tanks was not occupied continuously for 10 millennia, it is  the only place in the region where every prehistoric and historic time period  is represented.&nbsp; Water was the main  resource that spurred repeated use of areas around the rock hills during this  long time span.&nbsp; Beginning in prehistoric  times it was retained behind simple dams, allowing greater numbers of people to  gather.&nbsp; The rock hills strongly  influenced settlement in other ways: &nbsp;they  provided shelter, served as a canvas for rock imagery, provided a base for  food-processing facilities, and yielded fragments for use as heating elements  in hearths and plant roasting pits.</p>
      <p align="left">The earliest people at Hueco Tanks were Paleoindian hunters wielding spears with Folsom points, who used a narrow pass between the rock hills to hunt herd animals, probably bison. Early, Middle, and Late Archaic groups hunted a diverse array of smaller  animals, and processed wild plants in rock mortars while occupying nearby  shelters. </p>

      <p>The most intensive occupations took place during the Do&ntilde;a Ana phase, between  A.D. 1000 and 1300, when groups occupied many areas around the rock hills.&nbsp; In the northeast part of the Tanks, a cluster  of rectangular houses was built near areas of moist soils that were used as  fields.&nbsp; In another area, leaf succulents  were harvested from patches where they thrived, and roasted in bulk in  rock-lined pits.&nbsp; Almost all of the items  used by prehistoric groups during this time were obtained in or near the Hueco  Bolson, but pottery reached them through an interregional trade network that  involved groups to the north and northwest, and to a limited extent, Mexico.</p>
      <p>Hueco Tanks also was a focal point in the sacred landscape of the eastern  Hueco Bolson for a thousand years or longer, beginning in Late Archaic times.&nbsp; The abundant rock imagery primarily appears  to represent ritual petitions for rain; sacred precincts were established high  on the hills, and the Tanks were the final resting place for many.        </p>
      <p>Native groups established a trail that ran through the Tanks toward water  and salt sources on the east, and their descendants guided military scouts and  travelers along it, beginning in 1692.&nbsp; During  the centuries that followed, gold-seekers, cattle drovers, military and  railroad surveyors, and other adventurers on the trail marked their names on  the rocks. &nbsp;A stage station was briefly  established at the Tanks in the late 1850s.&nbsp;  The first permanent historic occupation was the Escontrias ranch, established  in 1898 and operating until 1956.&nbsp;  Military training was conducted at the Tanks in the 1940s and 1950s. &nbsp;Recreational activities that began before the  turn of the century culminated in establishment of the state park in 1970.&nbsp; This many-faceted story is reviewed below.</p>
      <h3 align="left">Earliest People<a name="earliest"></a></h3>
<p align="left">The earliest human-made objects found at Hueco Tanks are fluted lanceolate points of the Folsom culture.  Between 9,000 and 8,200 B.C., these mobile groups hunted large herd animals across the grass-covered basins between the mountain ranges.  In this region, Folsom hunters spent the winter in the broad basins near the Rio Grande valley, and then headed north to hunt on the southern Great Plains during the summer and early fall.  Although the diet of Folsom people included a number of plants and animals, their most notable prey was the huge straight-horned Ice Age bison, <em>Bison antiquus</em>, now extinct.  Folsom camps typically were positioned at locations offering an overview of the surrounding area and ready access to water.  At Hueco Tanks, Folsom lance points were found on the rocks above a pass between two rock hills; bison could have driven between the hills and hunted easily from that vantage point. </p>

<p align="left">Other Folsom camps in the region have been found in similar settings, including sites LA93330, LA93331, and LA93336, located on a ridge above an intermittent drainage in the Tularosa Basin of New Mexico.  Folsom points were clustered around Three Buttes-bedrock outcrops overlooking several large playas.  In the San Andres Mountains, a campsite containing Clovis and Folsom points and end scrapers was positioned at the mouth of Rhodes Canyon.  Early Paleoindian tools and Folsom points were found in sites 41HZ504 and 41HZ505, on the upper Hueco Mountain alluvial fan near Padre Canyon. </p>

<p align="left">Although many Folsom camps have been recorded in the region, sites dating to earlier (Clovis) and slightly later (Plainview and Scottsbluff) Paleoindian periods are not common.  Some sites of this age probably are deeply buried.  The big game hunting period ended because climate changes apparently caused a decline in large herd animals and <em>Bison antiquus</em> became extinct, causing groups to adopt a broader diet based on a variety of medium-sized and small animals and plants. </p>

<p>The earliest human-made objects that have been found at Hueco Tanks are  fluted lance points of the Folsom culture.&nbsp;  By 10,200 years ago, these groups roamed across the region and hunted a  large type of bison (now extinct), along with smaller animals. &nbsp;The weather was milder than it is today, with  cooler summers, warmer winters, and greater rainfall.&nbsp; Folsom hunters spent winters in the broad  basins near the Rio Grande valley, and then headed north to hunt on the  southern Great Plains during the summer and early fall.&nbsp; Folsom camps were occupied briefly, and typically  were located in places offering an overview of the surrounding area and ready  access to water. </p>
<p>Hueco Tanks offered all of these advantages to Folsom hunters, who camped in  the pass between two of the rock hills.&nbsp;  Bison could have been driven through that canyon and hunted easily from  the hills above.&nbsp; A few late Paleoindian lance  points reveal that hunters continued to camp and hunt in the pass after the  Folsom people left. </p>
<p>As the climate warmed between 9,000 and 8,000 years ago the large bison  became extinct, and people adopted a broader diet based on medium-sized and  small animals, supplemented by plants.&nbsp;  Hunters began to use throwing sticks we call atlatls to launch dart  points fastened onto spears.&nbsp; From 8,000 to  6,000/5,000 years ago during the Early Archaic period, Hueco Tanks was visited  occasionally as hunters moved seasonally from camp to camp.&nbsp; Visits to the Tanks increased between  6,000/5,000 and 3,200 years ago during the Middle Archaic period, when activities  were focused on the central area between the rock hills.</p>
<p>In Late Archaic times between 3,200 and 1,800 years ago, populations were  growing in the region, and many groups camped for short periods around the rock  hills of Hueco Tanks.&nbsp; In the southwest part  of what is now the state park, a longer-term camp composed of small, temporary  huts may have been built near many small rock hearths used for cooking and  heating.&nbsp; Groups also are likely to have  camped in rockshelters during the Middle and/or Late Archaic periods.&nbsp; The Late Archaic diet included a wide range  of desert shrubs, succulents, and leafy plants; mesquite beans and other seeds  were crushed in deep mortar holes in the rocks.&nbsp;  Pictographs were first painted in sheltered areas of Hueco Tanks during  the Archaic period, including abstract images and realistic hunting scenes that  probably represented a spiritual relationship between predator and prey.</p>
<h3 align="left">From Mobile to More Settled Lifeways<a name="lifeways"></a></h3>
<p>Pottery came into use around 1,800 years ago in the western Trans-Pecos area,  marking the beginning of the Formative period.&nbsp;  Populations continued to increase, causing changes in settlement, diet,  and technology to occur more rapidly.&nbsp;  The Formative period is divided into the Mesilla, Do&ntilde;a Ana, and El Paso phases, which  mark some of these major changes. <br>
  From 1,800 to 1,000 years ago during the Mesilla phase, settlement shifted  from basin areas toward slopes below mountain ranges.&nbsp; People began to stay at Hueco Tanks for  longer periods of time.&nbsp; They joined  together in camps like the one that was established in the northwest part of  Hueco Tanks, where simple round huts may have stood near a few small rock  hearths used for cooking and heating. </p>
<p>Mesilla phase populations increasingly hunted the abundant jackrabbits and  cottontails that inhabited the basins, adopting the bow and arrow technology  around 1,200 years ago.&nbsp; Most of the pots  that were used were undecorated El Paso Brown jars, made locally.&nbsp; Distinctive Mimbres Black-on-white bowls were  obtained through trade with groups in southwestern New Mexico, possibly to maintain friendly  relations between growing populations in both regions. </p>
<p>Between 1,000 and 700 years ago during the Do&ntilde;a Ana phase, more people lived  at Hueco Tanks than during any other period before or after.&nbsp; Across the region, settlements concentrated  in similar settings on slopes below mountains, to take advantage of water that  ran down the slopes after seasonal rains.&nbsp;  A 100-year period of warm and dry weather was followed by relatively  cool and wet weather for several centuries.</p>
<p>During the middle to late Do&ntilde;a Ana phase, a group of rectangular houses was  built in the northeast part of Hueco Tanks near patches of moist soil that were  used as fields to grow corn and beans (see <a href="http://www.texasbeyondhistory.net/hueco/life.html" target="_blank"><strong>Village Life</strong></a> for more details).&nbsp; In another area of  the Tanks, agave, sotol, and/or yucca plants were harvested with large chipped  stone knives, and their root balls were rendered edible through slow roasting  in rock-lined pits.&nbsp; A large chipped  stone knife found near one pit could have been used to remove the spiny agave  leaves, for it is similar to the expedient (quickly made) knives found near  agave roasting pits at the <strong><a href="http://www.texasbeyondhistory.net/trans-p/images/ap2.html" target="_blank">Wind  Canyon</a></strong> site. </p>
<p>Small rock dams were built to hold the water that flowed down cracks and  chutes on the rock hills during late summer rains.&nbsp; The three largest basins held thousands of  gallons of water for extended periods, and allowed more people to stay at the  Tanks for longer periods of time.&nbsp; During  dry spells, crops may have been kept alive by carrying pots of water from the  rock hills and pouring it around their roots. </p>
<p>Although jackrabbits and cottontails were hunted at the Tanks and in the  nearby basin, hunters sometimes ranged into the Hueco  Mountains and down to the Rio Grande in search of  game.&nbsp; These longer trips were required  to supply meat for the large number of people who were relying on the resources  of Hueco Tanks during the Do&ntilde;a Ana phase.</p>
<p>The spiritual importance of water was recognized through images on the walls  of rockshelters at Hueco Tanks.&nbsp; Most of  the figures probably were painted during the Do&ntilde;a Ana phase, when the greatest  number of people lived there.&nbsp; Many  images appear to represent prayers for a continuing supply of life-giving water.&nbsp; Spiritual leaders probably directed the type  and placement of images on the rocks.&nbsp;  Some images were painted in hidden areas high on the rock hills, and apparently  had greater spiritual status. </p>
<p>Spiritual leaders also are likely to have supervised burial of the many individuals  who were laid to rest at Hueco Tanks.&nbsp;  The number of known prehistoric graves is among the highest in the  region, and more may be present.&nbsp; The  Tanks served a special role in the sacred landscape of the eastern Hueco Bolson  as a place to live, obtain and pray for water, commune with the spirits, and lay  cherished individuals in their final resting places.&nbsp; However, the plant, animal, water, and rock  resources of Hueco Tanks that made it such a good place to meet the needs of  daily life apparently prevented it from achieving the highly sacred status of places  like Ceremonial and Picture   Caves.&nbsp; Located 3 miles to the west, these large  rockshelters were visited on pilgrimages by people from the Tanks and other  areas across the region (see <a href="http://www.texasbeyondhistory.net/ceremonial/index.html" target="_blank"><strong>Ceremonial Cave</strong></a><strong></strong>), who left humble  offerings of sandals and other more elaborate items.</p>
<p>Local pottery was used in increasing quantities during the Do&ntilde;a Ana phase,  and was made nearby but not at Hueco Tanks.&nbsp;  Paint had first been applied to the rims of plain brown jars between  1,200 and 1,000 years ago in the late Mesilla phase.&nbsp; Simple designs initially were painted in  black or red to produce El Paso Bichrome, and soon, both colors were used on El  Paso Polychrome pottery.&nbsp; Groups at Hueco  Tanks also obtained pots through an interregional trade network, which shifted  from southwest New Mexico to south-central New Mexico during the  Do&ntilde;a Ana phase.&nbsp; Small-mouthed Chupadero  Black-on-white jars were imported in large numbers and used to carry water and  other liquids, and Three Rivers Red-on-terracotta bowls also were obtained  through trade.&nbsp; The network brought small  amounts of pottery from more distant areas, including a beautiful pendant made  from St. Johns Polychrome pottery from west-central New   Mexico, and a few painted Ramos Polychrome and Villa Ahumada  Polychrome pots from northern Mexico.</p>
<p>By 700 years ago at the beginning of the El Paso phase, the small fields at Hueco  Tanks were not producing enough corn and beans to sustain the growing numbers  of people who lived there.&nbsp; Settlement  shifted to areas near playas (large shallow seasonal ponds) at the base of  alluvial fans, where broad areas of soil retaining subsurface moisture were  available for fields.&nbsp; Pueblos were established 6 miles to the northwest,  7 miles to the west, and 8 miles to the south of Hueco Tanks.&nbsp; The pueblo to the north may have had as many  as 100 rooms.&nbsp; Cottonwood  beams used to build the roof of at least one room most likely were carried from  the Tanks, the nearest source of that wood.&nbsp;  The smaller pueblos were similar to <strong><a href="http://www.texasbeyondhistory.net/firecracker/index.html" target="_blank">Firecracker  Pueblo</a></strong> and<strong> <a href="http://www.texasbeyondhistory.net/madera/index.html" target="_blank">Madera Quemada</a></strong>, El Paso phase pueblos on the west side of the  basin.</p>
<p>Another resource that probably was transported from Hueco Tanks to the  pueblos was water, carried in pots and other containers along a trail that led  northwest from the Tanks toward two pueblos.&nbsp;  Pueblo residents also made brief visits to the Tanks to hunt jackrabbits  and cottontails, gather and perhaps roast small amounts of wild plants, obtain  stone for grinding tools, and possibly to paint prayer petitions in the  rockshelters.&nbsp; Although the pueblos were  involved in far-flung trade networks during the El Paso phase, almost none of those exotic items  were brought to Hueco Tanks.</p>
<p>The period of abundant rainfall during the El Paso phase ended with several severe,  short-term droughts around 550 years ago.&nbsp;  People abandoned the pueblos, Hueco Tanks, and most of the region,  although some groups may have remained, including the Manso and Suma who were  encountered along the Rio Grande around 400 years ago.&nbsp; Those groups occupied brush huts and obtained  food by hunting and gathering.</p>
<p>Apache Indians slowly entered the region from the north, and by 300 years  ago were using Hueco Tanks and the surrounding area as their hunting  ground.&nbsp; They roasted agave, sotol,  and/or yucca root balls in a large rock-lined pit at Hueco Tanks, and obtained  water from pools on the rock hills.&nbsp; They  added images to the growing gallery in the rockshelters, as did Kiowa and/or  Comanche Indians who visited the Tanks from 200 to 100 years ago.

<h3 align="left">Historic Period<a name="historic"></a></h3>
<p>The earliest written account of Hueco Tanks dates to in 1692, when Spanish  troops stopped there before heading through a pass in the Hueco Mountains  to obtain salt from sources further east.&nbsp;  They were led by an Apache captive along a trail that connected a series  of major springs and water sources between the Pecos  River and the Rio Grande.&nbsp;  The route probably had been used for centuries before Europeans and  Americans arrived in the region.&nbsp; Mescalero  Apache groups camped in or around the Tanks in 1777, having been pushed out of  their home ranges in and near the Organ, Sacramento,  and Sierra Blanca Mountains  by Comanche Indians encroaching from the north.<br>
  A conflict between Native Americans and Mexican troops in 1839 apparently  took place at Hueco Tanks.&nbsp; Some 60 years  later, ethnographer James Mooney set down a tale related by Kiowa informants of  warriors who were trapped in a rock-walled canyon for days, and eventually  escaped under cover of darkness.&nbsp;  Present-day Kiowa elders and others believe that the 1839 battle is  depicted on a rock imagery panel at the Tanks.</p>
<p>Acquisition of the territory by the United   States in the mid-nineteenth century brought an influx of  Anglo-American officials, adventurers, and settlers to El Paso.&nbsp;  Among the first U.S.  citizens to pass through the Tanks in 1849 were gold seekers heading west to California along the  trail.&nbsp; Inscriptions like the misspelled  &ldquo;Watter hear&rdquo;&mdash;painted in wagon wheel grease&mdash;document the importance of the  reservoirs of Hueco Tanks to travelers.&nbsp; The  trail was briefly used by the Butterfield Overland Mail stage line from 1858 to  1859; a stage station was built near the pass between the rock hills and a  large prehistoric reservoir nearby may have been reinforced.&nbsp; After the stage line was abandoned, travelers  continued to shelter inside the crumbling stone and adobe walls of the station for  decades.&nbsp; Buffalo Soldiers and others who  stopped by Hueco Tanks continued to commemorate their visits by marking their  names on the rocks. </p>
<p>In 1895, El    Paso businessman Juan Armendariz purchased three  sections centered on Hueco Tanks and began to use the area for ranching.&nbsp; Two large inscribed stones testify to  Armendariz&rsquo;s claim as the &ldquo;due&ntilde;o de este cerro&rdquo; (proprietor of this hill).&nbsp; A few years later, Silverio Escontrias bought  most of the Hueco Tanks ranch from Armendariz.&nbsp;  By 1904 he had built an adobe house, another three-room building, and a  two-room stable; the latter two buildings apparently were built with stones  from the old stage station.&nbsp; The Escontrias  family operated the cattle and horse ranch until the mid 1950s, and constructed  15 dams from rock, soil, and concrete to capture the water that ran off the hills. </p>
<h3 align="left"><strong>Modern Times <a name="modern"></a></strong></h3>
<p>The Escontrias family opened the Tanks to the public for recreation early in  the twentieth century, and the rock hills became a popular destination and  picnic ground frequented by persons from El Paso  and nearby Fort Bliss.&nbsp;  The Fort leased the ranch and used the Tanks for antiaircraft artillery training  in the 1940s and 1950s, and built a small landing strip on the north side of  the rock hills to launch planes towing targets.</p>
<p>The movement to designate Hueco Tanks as a public park began in 1922, when officers  of the fledgling El Paso Archaeological Society including Martin Crimmins and  Otis Aultman campaigned for the site in local newspapers.&nbsp; In 1935, the National Park Service offered to  purchase four sections around the Tanks, but Silverio Escontrias&rsquo; widow Pilar  was not interested in selling.&nbsp; The  Escontrias ranch was finally put on the market in 1956, and passed through a  series of owners, some of whom developed it as a tourist attraction.&nbsp; Rental cabins, stables, a caf&eacute;, and a fake  ghost town were constructed there at various times, and plans were floated for  large residential and resort developments.<br>
  Awareness of the significant rock imagery and archeology of Hueco Tanks and  its increasing rate of loss continued to grow in El Paso.&nbsp;  Members of local archeological and historical societies and faculty from  The University of Texas at El Paso  lobbied county officials, who purchased the property in 1965.&nbsp; With encouragement from state legislators,  the county transferred the property to the Texas  Parks and Wildlife Department in 1969,  and Hueco Tanks State Park  and Historic Site opened in June 1970.</p>
<p>Today, park rangers protect the archeology of this special place under the  authority of the Antiquities Code of Texas.&nbsp;  A Public Use Plan stipulates that areas containing highly significant  cultural and natural resources may be visited only in groups led by trained  guides, to ensure that those resources are not damaged.&nbsp; The Escontrias ranch house serves as the Interpretive Center  for Hueco Tanks State Park  and Historic Site, where visitors view an orientation video before they enter  the park.&nbsp; Campers, hikers, rock climbers,  and nature lovers continue to enjoy the recreational and educational aspects of  the park, while Mescalero Apache, Kiowa, Comanche, Ysleta del Sur Pueblo, Pueblo of Isleta Indians,  and other people find spiritual connections to this desert oasis.&nbsp; Through vigilant protection of the fragile  archeological sites, rock imagery, and wildlife of Hueco Tanks, the many hidden  facets of this significant place will continue to reveal secrets of desert  survival to future generations.</p>

Rock imagery also was found almost half of the shelters, including some that are too small to stand in. Bedrock served as the basis for over 400 grinding facilities on the lower elevations of the hills. Mortars predominate, with a smaller number of bedrock metates, both indicating locales where food was processed. Cupules (shallow mortars measuring 4 to 7 cm in diameter) were often found near rock imagery and could have been used for pigment preparation.</div></td>
