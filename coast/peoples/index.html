  <tr>
    <td width="480" height="2000" valign="top"><p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="left">The  Texas coastal prairies and marshlands is a region abundant in diverse  resources. Bordering the Gulf of Mexico, with its bays, estuaries, and barrier  islands, and tracking inland into sandy dunes, brackish marshlands, floodplain  forests, and prairie grasslands, the narrow region winds along the coast for  more than 600 miles, from Port Arthur to Brownsville. For thousands of years, aboriginal peoples  fished and collected marine resources along the sandy shores and trekked across  the prairies and marshes in search of wild game and fruiting plants. </p>
      <p align="left">In more recent times, remnant groups  of these longstanding cultures&mdash;the Atakapa, Akokisa, Karankawa, Mariames, Comecrudos, and others unnamed&mdash;were  encountered by European explorers, soldiers, and missionaries. Their prodigious  journals and official reports provide first-hand glimpses of the region&rsquo;s native  groups engaged in traditional lifeways which, in many cases, had changed little over the  centuries: fishing and  collecting shellfish from the bays and lagoons, and hunting and gathering  wild game and  plants across the prairies and river valleys.</p>
      <p align="left"> Among  the earliest accounts of native peoples are the 1537 journal of Cabeza de Vaca and the 1680s  chronicle by the Frenchman Henri Joutel, one of La Salle&rsquo;s colonists on the Texas coast.  These accounts differ greatly in perspective: Cabeza de Vaca and his  shipwrecked companions lived as captives among a succession of native groups in south Texas and along the coast. As a condition of  his existence, he &ldquo;became&rdquo; a native, performing grueling labors alongside  native women: grubbing for roots &ldquo;from morning to night,&rdquo; gathering plants and fruits, and  scrounging for firewood. As such, his accounts are an insider&rsquo;s view in  the truest sense, providing unprecedented details about native lifeways (see the TBH exhibit <strong><a href="../../cabeza-cooking/index.html" target="_blank">Learning from Cabeza de Vaca  </a></strong>for a detailed account of Cabeza de Vaca and his  journeys).</p>
      <p align="left">Joutel&rsquo;s diary, written some 150 years later,  is written from the perspective of a colonist&#8212;albeit a hapless and  unintentional one&#8212;encountering native groups (chiefly Karankawa) who viewed La  Salle and his colonists at Fort St.  Louis as unwelcome intruders in their land. The Frenchman, intent on sustaining  the meager colony in the wilderness while struggling with the erratic behavior  of La Salle, made little mention of native  ways, other than recording their periodic threats and attacks on the settlers.  </p>
      <p align="left">Spanish expeditions across the  region during the 17th and 18th centuries produced numerous documents mentioning their encounters  with native groups. All of these eyewitness  accounts of native peoples practicing traditional ways help us bridge the gap  between the distant prehistoric past&mdash;represented by mute artifacts and traces  in the dirt&mdash;and the modern world.  </p>
      <p align="left">From these records we learn that, although the many native  groups along the coast had their own distinctive traditions, languages, and  names for themselves, they shared an intimate knowledge of the  land and resources of their area. Many practiced similar subsistence strategies,  involving seasonal migrations from the coastal shores to the inland prairies to  harvest resources as they became available. </p>
        <p align="left"> But the coming of the Europeans&mdash;as well as intruding native  raiders, such as the  Comanche, Tonkawa, and Apache&mdash;triggered  devastating cultural  upheaval and movement among coastal native groups. Some were pressured southward into the traditional  territories of other native groups, others forced into slavery, and others enticed or coerced into Spanish missions.  Some tried to resist, either by force, or by passive means, such as &quot;visiting,&quot; rather than living at, missions  to obtain food as the need arose. Successes were few and only temporary.</p>
        <p align="left"> In the case of Indians of the Rio Grande delta in the early 1500s,  resistence to a Spanish expedition armed with cannons and crossbows is a remarkable story of strategy and wile &#8212;and was repeated successfully on three subsequent occasions. The Spaniards left, but, ultimately, others came in their place. Such was the case elsewhere along the coast. Native attempts to hold their lands were futile in the face of the larger, better-armed populations  carrying trade goods and disease. </p>
        <p align="left"> During the Historic period, sickness  and diseases brought by Spanish missionaries and French traders devastated entire villages.  To cite only a few examples, the mission Atakapans were stricken twice by disease in the 1750s, while Karankawas  suffered a &quot;devastating scourge&quot; of measles and/or smallpox in 1766. It was a gruesome story repeated  across the region and indeed much of North America:  disease, warfare, death, or assimilation. Within the course  of just a few centuries, most of the coastal native societies were gone  forever. </p>
        <p align="left">In the following sections, we look first at the lesser  known native populations of the lower coast, the peoples of the Rio Grande delta. From there we work upward to the Indians of  the central coast&mdash;the Mariames and the Karankawa&mdash;and finally to the groups of  the upper coast&mdash;the Atakapan speakers and Bidai</p>
        <p align="left">In addition we provide extensive links to other resources on <em>Texas Beyond History</em> that feature  data from Protohistoric, or early Historic, archeological sites in the coastal region. These  exhibits provide a look  at the physical traces left by the region's native peoples living during the time of early  European entry, from tools and camp debris to  ritual items and burials.In some cases, there are  particularly tantalizing clues to interaction.  In  the <a href="../../mitchell/index.html" target="_blank"> Mitchell Ridge</a> cemetery  site   on Galveston Island, for example, we see not only early Historic period European objects, such as glass trade beads and mirrors,  intermixed with traditional native objects, but also provocative bioarcheologcial  evidence suggesting interbreeding among native and European populations. In the case of La Salle's <a href="../../stlouis/index.html" target="_blank">Fort St. Louis</a> near Victoria, there is evidence that the Karankawa killed the French colonists in 1689 but subsequently lived and traded among the Spanish at the presidio built over the same site a few decades later. A number of archeologists and historians have specialized in the cultutural groups of the coastal region,   and references to their work are provided below for further information. </p>        </td>

    <td width="480"><h3>Peoples of the Lower Coast  and Rio Grande  Delta
        <a name="lower"></a></h3>
      <p align="left">When the waters of the Rio Grande  reach their destination at the Gulf of Mexico, they have traveled over 1,800  miles from the snow melt high in the Rocky Mountains.  Throughout their journey, these waters provided a rich environment for the  native peoples who occupied the river&rsquo;s banks. Teeming with fish, acting as a  magnet for birds and wildlife, and giving nutrients to plants, the river  offered a cornucopia of potential foods for the people who lived near it.  Nowhere was that food more plentiful than at its mouth in modern Cameron  County, Texas. Here, the Rio offered up not  only the fish, wildlife, and a variety of plant resources as it did upstream,  but, its mouth opened to a variety of salt water resources such as clams,  oysters, and salt-water fish. The native peoples of the Rio   Grande delta, like native people elsewhere in Texas, were knowledgeable about their  environment and exploited the best of its resources when they were available.  When those resources were not available, they survived by eating less  nutritious foods, or by gathering their children and loved ones and moving  elsewhere where other foods were could be found. </p>
      <p align="left">There are few early    accounts  of  native people living along this river's banks. From the archeological  record, however, we know that the region had been occupied by native groups for thousands  of years. Archeologists believe that during the early Historic era the region  was well-populated by descendants of the prehistoric inhabitants, and this is  borne out by historic records. However, not many sites dating to this time  period have been recorded. A few sites, such as 41CF136 in Cameron County  contain both native-made shell implements as well as a French musket gunflint  and a thin piece of copper wire. These  objects may represent contact with  Europeans or recycling of discarded materials. Re-use of European goods is well  documented in the region. In the 1750s,  Spanish colonizer Jos&eacute; de Escand&oacute;n reported seeing a  boat on the Rio San Fernando southwest of the mouth of the Rio Grande. Made from milled lumber, the  boat had been fashioned from the remains  of a French vessel and was being used as a fishing vessel by the Comecrudos, a  local Indian nation. </p>
      <p align="left">Why there are so few sites with evidence of European contact  is somewhat puzzling, but may be attributed to interrelated factors. Compared to other  regions, few sites have been excavated in the Rio Grande delta. Those that have generally  show low densities of artifacts, perhaps making some archeologists reluctant to  dig at sites with likely meager results. At the same time, numerous archeological  sites  have been eradicated in the crush of agricultural, urban,  and residential  development in the area. Consequently, the sites that are known may not accurately represent what was there in early Historic times. </p>
      <p align="left">In contrast with the archeological record, the  ethnohistorical record&mdash;documents, maps, and drawings&mdash;offers some hope for  understanding the native peoples of the lower coast, although it too is less  robust than desired. An excellent summary of the documentary record was  published in 1990 by Mart&iacute;n Salinas<em>. </em>Intrigued by the native peoples who resided on both  sides of the Rio Grande prior to the establishment of Texas, he researched  Spanish, English, and French records, maps, and other documents dating prior to  1850 to learn about the original inhabitants of his native land.</p>
      <p align="left">Early Spanish reports of expeditions mounted by Francisco  Garay to assess the delta and its resources&mdash;including potential native laborers&mdash;provide  glimpses of fierce local natives resisting in the face of European might. In  the first expedition in 1519, four ships stopped at the mouth of the Rio Grande for 40 days.  While there, an exploring party was sent up the river some 16 miles. In this  exploratory effort the Spaniards counted 40 rancher&iacute;as or encampments of  Indians&mdash;a quantity that is relatively substantial for such a short distance. At  first, the native peoples treated the light-skinned strangers as friends, or at  least as equals who merited a polite greeting. As a result of this friendly  reception, Garay, the governor of Jamaica, sent three more ships with  150 men, seven horses, and some artillery to the mouth of this same river. </p>
      <p align="left">The Garay expedition, however, was not to merely explore the region more fully, but also  to occupy the land along the Rio    Grande. Sensing this change in intent, the natives  made it clear that they were not pleased, and put into play a plan of their  own. They mustered large numbers of reinforcements, likely accomplished by dispatching  runners from one rancheria to another. Then, using canoes, the natives drove  Spanish boats from the river. During the process, 18 Spanish soldiers were  killed along with horses. Garay&rsquo;s Spanish soldiers, recognizing that they were  outmaneuvered, fled south by boat and by land. Accounts suggest that the attack was rapid,  well planned, and did not allow the foreign intruders the means or time to  counter-attack. The events are  remarkable considering that the native weapons&mdash;bows and arrows&mdash;would have paled  in response to well-aimed firings from the cannons on Spanish ships. The planning,  the ability to bring together a large force, and the will to carry out their  threat are indicators of the fierceness of the local native population and  their attachment to their land. </p>
      <p align="left">Two more attempts by Garay were met with equal effectiveness  by the native peoples, first with another armed response, then with a  well-planned disappearance into the brush country. Lacking natives to serve as  worker bees for his colony, Garay decided to travel south to Mexican ports. His  departure from the Rio Grande  gave local native peoples nearly 200 years of peace from Spanish intrusions  into the delta region. </p>
      <p><strong>Groups with No Names?      </strong></p>
      <p align="left">One of the curious aspects of early documents pertaining to  the lower coast is that no names are provided for any of the rancherias or the  native people themselves. This is unusual. In most expeditions, the Spanish  either phonetically wrote down the names the people gave for themselves, or  they arbitrarily assigned names to the people based on their physical  characteristics, hair style or color, unique qualities of the physical place  they lived, or some other unique characteristic. Yet, no names were assigned to the rancherias  or native peoples encountered in 1519.</p>
      <p align="left">In the mid-1600s, this trend of not naming groups  changed&mdash;with a vengeance. Salinas discovered an  abundance of native group names in the records for this period, but most  represented groups who had moved to the Rio    Grande delta after 1600. About that time, Spanish  settlement began south of the Rio    Grande in Nuevo Leon. By 1650, some 350 named Indian  groups were recognized in that region. We do not know that they represented  &ldquo;tribes&rdquo; per se. Some may have been small family lineages. Others may have  represented villages. The names, however, were repeated in multiple Spanish  documents suggesting that these groups had some permanency in the region. One  of the facts that became clear to the Spanish during this period is that most  of the groups in eastern Nuevo Leon  were, or at least included among them, people displaced from regions to the  west. These groups were generally hostile to the Spanish settlements and  ranches and consistently raided them.</p>
      <p align="left">In 1747, Jose de Escand&oacute;n began establishing colonies in  northeastern Mexico.  In Texas, Escand&oacute;n&rsquo;s settlements were  established on both sides of the Rio Grande,  many of them in the area of modern Laredo (see <a href="../../falcon/index.html" target="_blank"><strong>Falcon Reservoir: Ghosts of Spanish Ranchos</strong></a>).  However, he also established some settlements in Tamaulipas, just south of the Rio Grande. Documents  associated with his initial settlements and subsequent inspections of these  settlements offer more information on the native peoples who had moved into the  Rio Grande delta region of the Lower   Texas coast. From his reconnaissance of the region north and south  of the Rio Grande  in 1747, we learn the names of the then resident native groups, as shown in the  table below.</p>
      <p align="left">Groups are listed in the order encountered by Escand&oacute;n,  along with alternative spellings and pronunciations in Spanish. It is doubtful  that groups listed in the same row shown in the table lived across the river  from each other, but the listings give a sense of their distance from the mouth  of the Rio Grande  and the Rio San Juan. Some of these groups may have had remnants of the  original inhabitants that Garay and his men encountered 200 years previously.  While no population counts are available for groups living north of the river,  Escand&oacute;n puts the population of native peoples south of the river at 2,500  families. Perhaps a similar number existed north of the Rio Grande.</p>
      <p align="left">Some names in the table were given Spanish equivalents. Masa  cuajulam were said to be <em>Los que andan  solos </em>meaning &ldquo;those who walk alone. Paranpa matuju were called <em>bemejos los hombres </em>meaning &ldquo;the men are  red.&rdquo; Salinas  says this &ldquo;may refer to skin color or, perhaps more likely, to male use of red  pigment for body painting on special occasions.&rdquo; Perpepug meant <em>cabezas blancas </em>or &ldquo;white heads&rdquo; in  English, perhaps referring to the forehead. Peupuetem were said to be <em>los que hablan differente </em>meaning &ldquo;those  who speak differently.&rdquo; Whether this refers to a different language or a unique  accent is not clear. Segujulapem were said to be <em>los que viven in los Guiachs </em>meaning &ldquo;those who live in huisache  thickets.&rdquo; Sepin pacam were said to be <em>los  salineros </em>or the salt makers. There are several important saline lakes  north of the Rio Grande,  the largest known as<a href="../../st-plains/images/he5.html" target="_blank"> El Sal del Rey</a>.  A number of sites have been recorded around  the lake and likely represent efforts of local prehistoric and historic native  peoples to exploit the rich salt deposits that are found on the soil around the  lake. The Sepim pacam may have resided in the general vicinity of this lake.</p>
      <p><strong>Comecrudos</strong></p>
      <p align="left">Three groups of native peoples were called <em>Comecrudos </em>in the 1700s, a term meaning  &ldquo;those who eat raw food.&rdquo; Two lived south in Tamaulipas, but the third is  associated with the Rio Grande  delta. Salinas  believes that is it unlikely that any of them were related. Their name appears  to represent the Spanish characterization of their dietary habits. Those  associated with the Rio Grande  delta region may have been noted in some documents from the 1730s when there  was a reference to raw food being consumed near the Rio San Juan. However, Escand&oacute;n  clearly noted them in his 1747 reconnaissance of the Rio Grande. At that time, they were led by a  &ldquo;Captain Santiago&rdquo; (note the Spanish surname) who led other Indians in the  region along with the Comecrudos. Escand&oacute;n, camping near modern Matamoros, evidently asked  him to bring other groups to visit with him. Captain Santiago did so via smoke  signals, and some 200 families responded to the signals. They represented some  30 different groups then living in the area. Escand&oacute;n stated that the  Comecrudos, however, were the most numerous group among them. <strong></strong></p>
      <p align="left">In subsequent years, life for the Comecrudos became harsh.  They moved into Mission San Joaquin del Monte at modern Reynosa, Mexico  around 1749. At that time they numbered around 150. By 1757, only 95 were  listed in the census of the mission. They remained at the mission as late as  1886, but numbered only 25 by that time. </p>
      <p align="left">Little is known about the daily lives of the Comecrudos, but  we can infer some important aspects of their diet, clothing, and customs. Certainly,  fishing was important to groups living along the Rio Grande near its mouth. In the 1680s  Indians gave Spaniards fish, and Escand&oacute;n reported that fish continued to be  important to them in the 1750s. Salinas  describes reports of bow and other types of fishing in the coastal lagoons of  the mouth of the Rio Grande:  &ldquo;The Indians waded out into the water that was sometimes waist deep, quickly  taking large numbers of fish.&quot; Another source noted that fishing was seasonal  and that fish were dried and stored for later use: &quot;Indians fished during the  winter when foods were scarce&hellip;.[L]ong nets [were used], made from soft yucca  fibers with a mesh so fine that even the smallest fish were caught.&rdquo; Wild plants were also important in their  diet, particularly prickly pear tunas, mesquite bean pods, and maguey root  crowns. </p>
      <p align="left">Men were generally described as going without clothing. Women wore  only skirts of animal skins or grass. Cabeza de Vaca and his companions,   who had lost all of their European clothing after the shipwreck, found wearing native attire especially difficult; they often found themselves cold during the winters. By  the late 1700s, both sexes were reported to wear skins or cloth clothing,  likely an adaptation to Spanish influences. Many of the Rio Grande groups practiced tattooing.  Whether the Comecrudos did is not known. </p>
      <p align="left">Later travellers observed other adaptations among  native groups in the area. In the 1830s, Jean Louis Berlandier, traveling along the Rio Grande during his expedition to Mexico, made  note of  small native groups such as the Garzas and Carissos [Carrizos]  still living in somewhat traditional lifeways and linked by a common enmity  toward Comanche raiders.       
      <p align="left">
        <em>The huts which form the  outskirts of Mier are inhabited by a single tribe of indigenes known as the  Garzas, who resemble the Carrizos in every way.  All speak Spanish perfectly and besides have preserved their own particular  tongue&hellip; The chief and his subjects&hellip;have not retained anything of a savage life,  other than their nudity and a taste for travels in the forests. They go hunt in the forest to provide for  their subsistence&hellip;. All these distinct nations&mdash;formerly savage and today  reduced to living in society&mdash;preserve an implacable hatred of the Comanche,  against whom they have sometimes waged war in favor of Mexican towns. </em>
      </p>
     
      <p align="left">Much has changed  on the Rio Grande  delta since the time when aboriginal peoples lived there. In 1519, Spanish  explorer Alonso Alvarez reported that the river's mouth was more than 30 feet  deep; he could sail his four large vessels some 20 miles up the river. Today the Rio Grande  typically is little more than a trickle when it empties into the Gulf of Mexico. </p>

      <h3>Peoples of the Central   Coast
        <a name="middle"></a></h3>
      <p align="left">The central stretch of the Texas coastal shores and inland  grassy plains was the domain of the<strong> </strong>Karankawa,<strong> </strong>the overarching name given to at least  five distinct groups of native peoples who shared a common language and culture&mdash;the  Carancaguases, Cocos, Cujanes, Guapites (Coapites), and Capoques. During the 16th  and 17th centuries, these names were recorded, with numerous  variations in spelling, by Cabeza de Vaca and other Europeans who encountered  them as they traveled through the region. Farther inland lived the Mariames and other small groups whose  names and cultures largely have been lost to history.</p>
      <p align="left"><strong>Karankawa</strong></p>
      <p align="left">Historic maps depict the central coastal region and part of  the upper coast, extending from Corpus Christi Bay to Galveston Bay, as the  home of <em>Wandering Tribes</em>, and this  aptly describes the Karankawa (and many other groups, as well). In a  long-established and successful adaptive pattern&mdash;perhaps extending back some  3,000 years in time&mdash;Karankawa groups migrated seasonally from the mainland area  to the coastal bluffs and barrier islands as resources became available. This  mobile lifestyle was accomplished in part through use of dugout canoes in which  fishermen plied the bays and estuaries and ventured inland along rivers and  streams. Crudely built but sometimes large, some vessels reportedly  accommodated  entire families and their possessions in moving between camps. </p>
      <p align="left">Each year, during the fall and winter months, groups of  Karankawa familes gathered together in large fishing camps along the coast to  harvest a variety of fish and shellfish, make tools, and other perform maintenance tasks.  Their temprary homes were   huts of thin poles, brush, and hide which could be easily  packed and moved to the next camp. The cooler months are prime times to  catch schooling fish such as redfish  as they head into the deeper waters of the Gulf. According to historic accounts, fishermen used weirs placed  at tidal passes to trap  fish as they moved  seaward. Based on archeological ebidence, we know they used a variety of other types of  fishing gear as well &mdash;spears, bows and arrows, and even baited shell hooks&mdash;to  procure a successful harvest. Shellfish, too, such as <em>Rangia</em> <em>cuneata </em>clams, oysters, and conch,  were gathered from the muddy bottoms and banks of shallow bays and estuaries. These  provided both food and hard shell to make into tools and ornaments. </p>
      <p align="left">In spring and summer, the group split into smaller parties to  hunt deer and buffalo and gather roots and fruiting plants in the coastal  prairies. Based on archeological evidence from both coastal and prairie sites, Karankawa territories  appear to have extended inland some 40 kilometers (roughly 25 miles) from the  upper bays along the coast. Beyond this boundary, other native groups with quite different cultures  and languages made their home, and it is likely that the various groups  maintained trade relations, if not social networks.</p>
      <p align="left">Karankawa bands were typically composed of some 30 or 40 people and were headed by &quot;chiefs.&quot; Anthropologist Albert Gatschet, who became interested in the coastal natives in the late 1800s, found that the Karanakwa were led by two types of chiefs: one for civil government and one for war. Both roles were reserved for men. As in many other native groups of the time, women had a lower status and performed the most tedious tasks in camp. According to Cabeza de Vaca, their labors included erecting and taking down huts, cooking, and collecting firewood. </p>
      <p align="left">The Karankawa were prolific pottery makers, crafting distinctive coiled-clay vessels  known to archeologists as Rockport ware. Vessel types included large ollas used for holding water and perhaps  dry foodstuffs such as seeds, as well as bowls and widemouth jars used for cooking and serving. The interiors of some pots were coated with asphaltum to seal and waterproof the container. The tar was also used  to decorate  vessels with dots, lines, and other designs and  to repair cracks. </p>
      <p align="left">Archeologist Robert Ricklis has studied similarities between prairie Karankawa sites and those attributed to the Toyah culture, which extended over a  large swath of central and south Texas in Late Prehistoric/Protohistoric times. Both peoples used similar tool kits and are distinguished primarily by their pottery. Toyah folk made a thin-walled, bone-tempered pottery termed Leon Plain. </p>
      <p align="left">A large number of archeological sites in the region have  been attributed to the Karankawa  (see the <a href="../../guadbay/index.html" target="_blank"><strong>Guadalupe Bay </strong></a>  and the <a href="../images/ap3.html" target="_blank">Kirchmeyer </a> exhibits). To learn more about the Karankawa, both in historic as well  as prehistoric times, see the Ethnohistory section of the <a href="../../mitchell/index.html" target="_blank">Mitchell Ridge </a>site. The <a href="../../stlouis/index.html" target="_blank">Fort St. Louis</a> and <a href="../../espiritu/index.html" target="_blank">Mission Espiritu Santo</a> site exhibits provide more information on Spanish attempts  to &quot;Christianize&quot; the Karankawa. </p>
     
      <p align="left"><strong>The Mariames</strong></p>
      <p align="left">Unlike the Karankawa, the Mariames  did not frequent the coastal bays or barrier islands. Instead they lived along  the &ldquo;River of Nuts&rdquo;&#8212;the lower Guadalupe   River&#8212; about 20 miles  inland. They moved their camps every few days, probably going up and down the  river through modern Refugio, Calhoun, and Victoria counties. Much of what we know about the Mariames comes  from the accounts of Cabeza de Vaca. Traveling down the coast around January,  1533, Cabeza de Vaca found his lost companions, Dorantes and Esteban, at the  River of Nuts living among the Mariames, and  his other comrade, Castillo, living with their neighbors, the Yguases. For nearly two years, the Spaniards lived with these native groups, and their accounts provide  a fairly intimate glimpse of how they lived. </p>
      <p align="left">The Mariames were described as hunters and  gatherers who &ldquo;grind up some little grains with them [the nuts, i.e. pecans]  two months of the year, without eating anything else, and even this they do not  have every year, because one year they [the trees] bear, and the next they do  not<em>.</em>&rdquo; While its seems improbable that  they ate nothing but pecans, ground or unground, for two months, it is likely  that nuts dominated their food during the harvests. </p>
      <p align="left">Cabeza de Vaca makes  similar statements about their limited menu when the Mariames were in the <em>tuna </em>fields, harvesting the fruits of  prickly pear cactus: &ldquo;They eat them three months of the year, in which they eat  nothing else.&rdquo; We also learn that Cabeza  de Vaca was not fond of their staple food&#8212;plants roots and bulbs.</p>
      <p align="left"><em>Their food supply is  principally roots of two or three kinds and they look for them through all the  country&hellip;.They [the roots] take two days to roast and many of them are bitter,  and on top of this is with great labor that they are dug out.</em></p>
      <p align="left">It&rsquo;s not clear if the Mariames ate  these roots because they preferred them or out of necessity. Cabeza de Vaca makes  it clear that the Mariames and other native groups did not always have adequate  food to eat, saying that they moved their camp every two or three days to look  for food.</p>
      <p align="left"><em>So great is the hunger that those people have that they cannot do  without them [the roots again], and walk two or three leagues looking for them.  Sometimes they kill some deer, and at times, they take some fish. But this is  so little and their hunger so great that they eat spiders and ant eggs and  worms and lizards and salamanders and snakes and vipers that kill the men they  bit, and they eat earth and wood and whatever they can get, and the dung of  deer and other things which I refrain from telling, and I believe truthfully  that if in that land there were rocks, they would eat them. They keep the fine  bones of the fish that they eat and of the snakes and other things, in order to  grind it all later and eat the powder from it.</em></p>
      <p align="left">Although he does paint a  picture of a people who sometimes went without food, he notes elsewhere that &ldquo;all  these people are archers and well built,<em>&rdquo;</em> suggesting that they were not starving or emaciated. On their trek to the tuna fields, they did not have food for  several days, but the Mariames did not seem discouraged. </p>
      <p align="left"><em>They, to cheer us up,  would tell us not to be sad, that soon there would be tunas and that we would  eat many and would drink their juice and would have our bellies very big.</em></p>
      <p align="left">The Mariames&rsquo; outlook on  life is detailed further: <em>&ldquo;</em>They  are very happy people; no matter how hungry they are, they do not stop dancing  or performing their celebrations and songs. For them the best time that they  have is when they eat the tunas, because then they are not hungry and all the  time they spend dancing, and they eat them night and day all the time that they  last.<em>&rdquo;</em></p>
      <p align="left">Life for Mariame women, however,  may at times have been quite difficult. Cabeza  de Vaca&rsquo;s accounts indicate that the only women among the Mariames were adults, and there was a reason for this.  Brides were never selected from within the Mariames or Yguases groups. They were  always obtained from their enemies by trading their best available bows  or, if that was not possible, a net for the brides. If the union produced a female baby, it  was killed. When asked why they did so, the Mariames said: &ldquo;because all those  of the land are their enemies and with them they have continual war, and if by  chance they should marry their daughters their enemies would multiply so that  they [the Mariames] would subject them and take them for slaves.<em>&rdquo; </em>The purchase of brides from enemies suggests two  things. First, enemies are regarded as powerful people on the horizon: people  to be feared, people to watch out for. They may have other qualities&mdash;mean,  cruel, ugly, terrible&mdash;but by definition an enemy is someone with the power to  hurt you or your kin. If they did not have this power, they would not be feared  and not an enemy. Therefore, a bride who comes from such a fearful group would  be expected to bear male children who would be as powerful as the enemy. Yet,  brides reared and taught by the enemy may have a darker meaning: can they be  trusted? There is nothing overt in Cabeza de Vaca&rsquo;s narrative to suggest that  the Mariames women were untrustworthy. There are hints, however, that women&rsquo;s  status within the society was quite distinct from the status of men. He states  that marriages &ldquo;<em>do not last longer than  they are content and for a trifle they undo the marriage.&rdquo; </em>The &ldquo;they&rdquo; in  this passage appears to refer to the men. Men, then, had the right to dissolve  marriages, but women did not. When it was dissolved, it is not clear what happened to the woman.</p>
      <p align="left">Mariame women were described as  hard workers and carried most loads: &ldquo;The men do not carry loads, or anything  of weight, but the women carry it and the old, who are the people that they  regard least.&rdquo; It is not entirely clear, but this passage seems to say that not  only do the women carry most loads, they are also only one rung up the status  bar from the old &ldquo;who are the people that they regard least.&quot; He relates further: <br>
          <em>The women are very hard workers and capable  of a great deal, for of 24 hours that there are in a day and night they have  only six hours of rest and all the rest of the night that they spend in  stirring their ovens in order to dry those roots that they eat. And, from dawn  they begin to dig and to bring wood and water to their houses and to put in  order the other things of which they have need.</em></p>
      <p align="left">Mariame men had the job of hunting,  and Cabeza de Vaca notes they were capable of running all day in pursuit of a  deer. They also often hunted in larger  groups, using torches to herd deer into groups and dispatching them within the  circle. Using this strategy&mdash;hunting in a surround&mdash;they reportedly could kill 200-300 at a time on occasion. Often, as  not, however, none were killed, and hunters (or the women and children)  depended on trapping rodents.

      <p align="left">The upper coast was home to  the Akokisa, Bidai, and other smaller groups of Atakapan speakers, whose territories bordered those of the Karankawa (Cocos), the Caddo to the north, and Southeastern groups to the east. It is believed that the Akokisa and Bidai  shared a  common linguistic and cultural tradition with the Atakapa of south-central and  southwestern Louisiana.  The Akokis and Bidai are assumed to have spoken a   Western Atakapan dialect, while the peoples living in the Lake Charles area of Louisian spoke an Eastern Atakapan dialect. Some have suggested that the eastern and western groups spoke their own language in addition to a common second language. Unfortunately, so little is known of the Atakapan language family that the precise linguistic relations may never be known. </p>
      <p align="left">Archeologist Lawrence Aten  believes the historically known Atakapan-speaking tribal groups are  part of the <strong><a href="../prehistory/images/mossy.html" target="_blank">Mossy Grove</a> </strong>culture pattern that extended over a large swath of the upper  coast and prairie region from southwestern  Louisiana to roughly the Brazos River  in Texas.   Aten holds that the ancestors of the Akokisa and the more inland Bidai  shared for an extended  time period&mdash;perhaps as long as 2000 years&mdash;many cultural, technological, and  linguistic similarities that were fairly distinct from surrounding ethnic  groups, such as the Hasinai (Caddo). Coastal Mossy  Grove peoples and their descendants appear to have been hunter-fisher-gatherers whose subsistence was based on  game, fish, wild plants, and shellfish taken from in and around the  estuaries, bayous,  lagoons, and bays along the upper coast. </p>
      <p align="left">These long-established subsistence patterns as well as traditional territories slowly began to change as Europeans came into the country, with influences and disease transmitted in advance of their actual entry to the region.  Shipwrecked Europeans, including Cabeza de Vaca and the Frenchman De Bellisle, arrived on the upper  coast, but remained only until they could escape or move to another native group. Their presence may have had little impact on local peoples, but their accounts provide remarkable insights into day-to-day native life. </p>
      <p align="left">Cabeza de Vaca, shipwrecked in 1528 on what  was likely Galveston Island, describes being found by a handful  of natives carrying bows and arrows; within a half-hour, he was captive in an  armed group of more than 100. According to his accounts, the native peoples were dependent on marine and terrestrial resources of the island in fall and winter months (fish, roots, and rats) and staples of the mainland and estuaries (deer, small game, rangia clams, berries and other plant foods) in the spring and summer months. As was the case for  Indians of the central coast, this dual mobility strategy at times involved  the use of dugout canoes to travel across deep water and gain access to many bodies of water with soft muddy bottoms that very difficult to cross by foot. Likewise, while barrier islands  are relatively large land masses easily visible from the mainland, are often separated by bay areas and tidal passes that are difficult to cross without boats. </p>
      <p align="left">Other than the few hapless visitors,  native groups of the upper coast had very  little contact with Europeans until the 1700s, after which time the region increasingly was the scene of  intense rivalry between the French and Spanish who vied for control of trade with native groups. The vast territories of New Spain and French Louisiana met along a border in the Sabine Lake area of Texas.  Rumors of incursions  by the French into New Spain, such as the ill-fated La Salle Colony in 1689, had prompted the Spanish to send a series of  expeditions along the Texas coast as far  north as Galveston   Bay. The Spanish found substantial reason to be concerned about their interests in the area. </p>
      <p align="left">In the 1720s both the Bidai and Akokisa (Orcoquisac) were participating in an illicit trade relationship with French traders. In exchange for deer  hides, furs, and bear grease, they received a variety of European goods, including guns, brought from New Orleans.  To deal with this encroachment, the Spanish government began establishing a greater  presence in southeast Texas. In 1756, the Spanish established a presidio and mission for the Akokisa on the east bank of the Trinity River, a site they called <a href="../images/he2.html" target="_blank">El Orcoquisac</a>. Although this establishment served to hamper trade with the French, the Spanish were less successful in forming their own relationships with the Indians. A planned  civil settlement in the area failed to develop, and in 1766 a hurricane devastated the mission and presidio. </p>
      <p align="left">The Spanish ultimately  broke their trade agreements with the Bidai when it was learned that they were  providing French firearms to the Lipan Apache and involved in other alliances  detrimental to the interests of New Spain. Ultimately breaking up into small bands, the Bidai were  devastated by epidemics, and by the middle of the 19th century,  there were few remaining. Those who survived joined other groups.</p>
      <p align="left">  Remnant groups of the Akokisa population remained in their traditional homeland into the 19th century. However, as Anglo-American settlers moved more aggressively into the region, surviving Akokisa  moved inland to join the Bidai. Based on remarkable documentary evidence uncovered by archeologists Roger  E. Moore and Madeliene Donachie, a few Akokisa/Bidai individuals who spoke the Atakapa language still lived in small groups in Harris   County as late as the  early 20th century.   They resided on land along Cypress Creek homesteaded  by Matthew Burnett in 1836. Burnett&rsquo;s daughter, Rebecca Burnett Lee, wrote a recollection of her early life that included details about the Indians who lived there, including a description of a chief named &ldquo;Francisco&rdquo;. Chief Francisco presided over a Bidai  dance held at a pavilion of bark apparently erected for the occasion. She  recalled Chief Francisco playing music on an instrument consisting of stretched  alligator hide over which a small stone was rubbed, producing a &ldquo;honk-honk&rdquo;  sound. </p>
      <p align="left">Mrs.  Lee&rsquo;s recollections were independently confirmed by the subsequent owner of the  homestead, Chester Telge. Mr. Telge&rsquo;s family bought the land from the Burnett&rsquo;s  in the 1850s. He was born there in 1918 and the Bidai were still living there  in hide tents on pimple mounds. Mr. Telge told Moore and Donachie that:<br>
            <em>&hellip;his father and grandfather gave the  Indians beef and hides periodically and went on to describe a charming incident  of reciprocity. On baking day, his grandmother would wrap up a large loaf of  bread and leave it on the back porch. By sundown, the Indians would have  exchanged it for a large catfish&hellip;.The end of the Bidai&rsquo;s occupation was marked  by the day in the early 1920s when the loaf of bread remained on the</em> <em>porch past sundown. Chester&rsquo;s grandmother brought  the bread back into the house, and announced in German that &ldquo;the Indians are no  more.&rdquo; </em></p>
