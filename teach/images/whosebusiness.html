					<p><strong>Activities and Procedures:</strong></p>
					<p>Step 1: With the entire class, brainstorm a list of the businesses and organizations that can be found in the school community. (Guide students to also include non-commercial sites such as churches, hospitals and schools.) Write the list on chart paper and post it where it can be seen easily.</p>
					<p>Step 2: Working with a partner or in small groups, students will examine the map of Fort Griffin on the web site or a print-out of the map and create a list of the businesses and buildings mentioned there. </p>
					<p>Step 3: With the entire class, create a composite list of the responses students noted in Step 2. Compare the lists and mark the responses common to both locations. Discuss the following questions: (Display the map of the Fort Griffin area to help students identify some of the reasons for the presence of certain businesses in the town.) </p>
					<ul class="bulleted">
						<li>What businesses and buildings do both communities have in common?</li>
						<li>Which businesses or buildings in the Fort Griffin community are not found in the community around the school? Why?</li>
						<li>Which businesses or buildings in the school community are not found in Fort Griffin? Why?</li>
						<li>What general factors determine which businesses or buildings will be in a community? </li>
					</ul>
					<p><em>Student Product</em>: Class lists of businesses in both communities.</p>

					<p><strong>Assessment/ Extension Activities:</strong> </p>

					<p>2. Explore the Fort Griffin site on Texas Beyond History: http://www.texasbeyondhistory.net/forts/griffin/index.html to learn more about the history of the community. On this webpage, the town of Fort Griffin is known as The Flat. Look up your own community’s web site to find out what it was like during the 1800’s. Draw a map of the community around your school showing all of the businesses and organizations in the area.
