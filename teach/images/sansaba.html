					</ul>
					<p><strong>Activities and Procedures:</strong></p>
					<p><em>Part 1</em></p>
					<p>Step 1: Show students the painting "The Destruction of Mission San Sabá in the Province of Texas and the Martyrdom of the Fathers Alonso de Terreros, Joseph Santiesteban." Ask students what they can infer about the following details in the painting:</p>
					<ul class="bulleted">
						<li>Time frame</li>
						<li>Location</li>
						<li>People involved</li>
						<li>Conflict</li>
						<li>Point of view of the artist</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Advise students that they will use a website to discover the facts of the story told in the painting.</p>
					<p>Step 2: Distribute the Mission San Sabá Study Questions. Have students answer the questions using information from the Texas Beyond History Mission San Sabá exhibit at: <a href="/sansaba/index.html" target="_blank">http://www.texasbeyondhistory.net/sansaba/index.html</a></p>
					<p><em>Part 2</em></p>
					<p>Step 3: KWL (Know, Want to know, Learned) activity: On butcher paper or other medium write the letters K, W, and L across the top. Under the letter K, have students list facts they already know about the Spanish mission system in Texas. Under the W have them list what they want to learn about this subject. The last part of the activity (what they Learned) will be completed at the end of part 2 of the lesson.</p>
					<p>Step 4: PERSIA Activity– Contrast Political, Economic, Religious, Social, Intellectual and Artistic ways of Spanish and Native Americans. Distribute the PERSIA model and PERSIA chart to students. Depending on the level of the class, the teacher may fill in the chart with student participation or students may use their Mission San Sabá Study Questions, textbooks, and the Mission San Sabá website to fill in the PERSIA chart with a partner or in small groups.</p>
					<p>Student Product: Answers to Mission San Sabá Study Questions and one or all of the additional assessment activities: Massacre or Victory essay, Mission Proposal Project, Mural Assignment.</p>
					<p>Closure: Fill in the L (what students learned) on the KWL chart from Part 1.</p>
					<p><strong>Extension Activities:</strong> Have students share their essays, mission proposals, or murals with the class.</p>
					<p><strong>Assessment:</strong> Give students the choice of completing one of the following assignments:</p>
					<p>1. Mission Proposal Project: In this assignment, students create a proposal for a successful Spanish mission by addressing and improving upon common problems that plagued the settlements.</p>
					<p>2. Distribute the "Massacre or Victory" reading student handout and have students read it aloud. Ask students to consider everything they have learned and then decide whether they believe the event at San Sabá was a massacre or a victory. They may use their Massacre or Victory Study Questions to help with this. Once students have formed an opinion, they will write a brief (one page) essay explaining and defending their position.</p>
					<p>3. Allow students to create a mural illustrating the events at Mission San Saba.  Have them adopt a point of view (Spanish, Natives, or a combination of both) when creating their product.</p>
