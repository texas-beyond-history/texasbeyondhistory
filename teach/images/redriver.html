					</ul>
					<p><strong>Activities and Procedures:</strong></p>
					<p><em>Day 1: Whose buffalo? Gathering information and using prewriting strategies</em></p>
					<p>Step 1: Show the Great Plains map. Explain that in the early 1800s there were 50-60 million buffalo roaming the Great Plains, but by 1890 the number had fallen to 750 and the animals were in danger of becoming extinct. </p>
					<p>Step 2: Show the Great Plains buffalo photograph and ask students if they have ever seen a real buffalo. Explain that in the 1870s two groups vied for the right to kill as many of these animals as they wished: the Plains Indians and white commercial buffalo hunters. In the 1870s, each side had supporters who hotly debated the "Whose buffalo?" issue. Advise students that they will gather information about both sides, then choose one side or the other to support.</p>
					<p>Step 3: Distribute the "Whose Buffalo?" graphic organizer to students. Explain to students that before deciding which side (the Indians or commercial hunters) they choose to support, they will gather at least 5 facts supporting each side, using a fact sheet and online exhibits at the Texas Beyond History website.</p>
					<p>Step 4: Distribute the "Whose Buffalo?" fact sheet.  Let students work with a partner to read the fact sheet and list arguments on each side of the graphic organizer. </p>
					<p>Step 5: Advise students that after they have read and gathered facts from the fact sheet, they may search for further arguments on the following websites: </p>
					<ul class="bulleted">
						<li><em>How Many Ways Can You Use a Buffalo?</em>: <a href="https://www.texasbeyondhistory.net/kids/buffalo.html" target="_blank">https://www.texasbeyondhistory.net/kids/buffalo.html</a></li>
						<li><em>Interview with a Buffalo Hunter</em>: <a href="https://www.texasbeyondhistory.net/kids/forts/13.html" target="_blank">https://www.texasbeyondhistory.net/kids/forts/13.html</a> </li>
						<li><em>Red River War</em>: <a href="http://www.texasbeyondhistory.net/redriver/index.html" target="_blank">http://www.texasbeyondhistory.net/redriver/index.html</a></li>
					</ul>
					<p><em>Day 2: Creating a Broadside</em> </p>
					<p>Step 1: Remind students that in Part I of this lesson, they identified arguments for the rights of both the Plains Indians and the commercial buffalo hunters. In Part II of the lesson, students will take a stand supporting the rights of either the Indians or the commercial hunters. </p>
					<p>Step 2: Introduce broadsides by asking students to discuss what forms of media they use to get their news.  List their responses. Point out that in the 1870s there were no televisions, radios, or Internet reports, and while newspapers were available in some towns and cities, it was the posting of broadsides that allowed people to express their political or social ideas in public.  Explain that the broadside was an inexpensively produced early form of mass media that was usually printed on one sheet of paper, and often contained illustrations and short songs or poems that could help get the author's message across to the public. They were generally posted in stores windows or other public places. </p>
					<p>Step 3: Advise students that in this part of the lesson they will work in a group to produce a broadside defending their chosen side of the "Whose buffalo?" debate. Distribute copies of the "Whose buffalo?" grading criteria to students and place a transparency of the grading criteria on the overhead.  Go over it with students. </p>
					<p>Step 4: Have students get into groups of 3 or 4, letting them choose group mates who share the argument they want to put forth in their broadside. Advise students they will need to consult the "Whose Buffalo?" grading criteria and divide up the work of creating their broadside among their group members. </p>
					<p>Step 5: Distribute supplies necessary for creation of the broadsides and allow enough time at teacher discretion for students to produce their broadsides. </p>
					<p>Step 6: Gallery Walk. Post each broadside on the walls of the classroom. Have the groups rotate to each broadside, spending 3-4 minutes discussing the other group's product. They might discuss what they found interesting and what was similar/different to their own.  What did they learn from this broadside that they didn't know before? Did this broadside change their opinion about the buffalo situation?  Then rotate to the next broadside and repeat.</p>
					
					<p><strong>Assessment Options or Extension Activities:</strong></p>
						<p>1. Have students list ways they might express their opinions today that didn't exist in the 1870s.</p>
						<p>2. Remind students that in the 1870s, killing of the Great Plains buffalo was a hotly debated issue. Ask students to identify issues dealing with animals that are controversial today.</p>
						<p>3. Have students view and discuss the actual text of the 1867 Medicine Lodge Treaty:  <a href="https://avalon.law.yale.edu/19th_century/kicoap67.asp" target="_blank">https://avalon.law.yale.edu/19th_century/kicoap67.asp</a></p>
						<p>4. Have students create bumper stickers for a controversial issue they want to support or protest.</p>
						<p>5. Pair this lesson with "Writing Contemporary Protest Music", also found on this website: <a href="https://texasbeyondhistory.net/teach/images/ransom-protest-song-teks.html" target="_blank">https://texasbeyondhistory.net/teach/images/ransom-protest-song-teks.html</a></p>
