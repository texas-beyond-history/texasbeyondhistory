					<p><strong>Activities and Procedures:</strong></p> 
					<p>Step 1: Students will get to know at least five of the residents of Fort Griffin and the surrounding area by visiting the interactive scene on the web site:<a href="http://www.texasbeyondhistory.net/kids/forts/index.html" target="_blank"> http://www.texasbeyondhistory.net/kids/forts/index.html</a>.</p>
					<p>Step 2: Students will take notes on each of the people they “meet”, recording information about their roles in the community and the details of their daily lives using the graphic organizer provided.</p>
					<p>Step 3: Students will choose one of the people they read about to research further. (For example, additional research on the life of Joe McComb, the buffalo shooter, could include research on the buffalo and the conflict between the Native Americans and the soldiers at the fort.) Online resources include the Fort Griffin webpages: <a href="http://www.texasbeyondhistory.net/forts/griffin/index.html" target="_blank">http://www.texasbeyondhistory.net/forts/griffin/index.html</a> </p>
					<p>Step 4: Each student will write a story or journal entry about a day in the life of the person they chose. The story should be written in first person and include details from the student’s research. </p>

					<p>2. Encourage students to have their chosen character interact with other characters from Fort Griffin/The Flat and include details about their lives and daily routines in their journal.</p>
					<p>3. Bind stories into student-made book covers and illustrate it.</p>
