					<p><strong>Author:</strong> Alice Elia, revised by Emily McCuistion (2023)</p>
					<p><strong>Time Duration:</strong> One 50-minute class period</p>
					<p><strong>Overview:</strong> This painted pebble activity is used to help students understand possible uses and importance of painted pebbles to Native Americans in Texas.</p>
					<p><strong>TEKS:</strong> <em>Art, Grade 4</em></p>
						<ul class="bulleted">
							<li>2(A), integrate ideas drawn from life experiences to create original works of art;</li>
							<li>2(B), create compositions using the elements of art and principles of design; and</li>
							<li>2(C), produce drawings; paintings; prints; sculpture, including modeled forms; and other art forms such as ceramics, fiber art, constructions, mixed media, installation art, digital art and media, and photographic imagery using a variety of art media and materials.</li>
							<li>3(B), compare purpose and content in artworks created by historical and contemporary men and women, making connections to various cultures</li>
						</ul>
						<p><em>Social Studies, Grade 4</em></p>
						<ul class="bulleted">
						<li>1(B), identify and compare the ways of life of American Indian groups in Texas before European exploration such as the Lipan Apache, Karankawa, Caddo, and Jumano</li>
					</ul>
					
					<p><strong>Materials:</strong><br></p>
					<ul class="bulleted">
						<li>Pictures of painted pebbles (included)</li>
						<li>Flat pebbles or small stones</li>
						<li>Small paint brushes</li>
						<li>Acrylic paint in a few different colors</li>
					</ul>
					<p><strong>Activities and Procedures:</strong> </p>
						<p>Step 1: Read “Painted Pebbles,” this excerpt taken from page 14 of Life in a Rock Shelter by G. Elaine Acker, to the class:</p>
						<p>“Archeologists have found a few examples of painted pebbles buried along with other artifacts at sites in the Lower Pecos. The smooth, flat, limestone rocks were decorated with geometrical designs and human-like faces. Although researchers suggest that the pebbles represent human beings, their actual purpose is unknown.”</p>
						<p>Show students the pictures of painted pebbles found in rock shelters in southwest Texas. Photographs of painted pebbles can be found here: www.texasbeyondhistory.net/pecos/everyday.html</p>
						<p>Step 2: Discuss possible uses/importance of painted pebbles. Questions could include:</p>
						<ul class="bulleted">
							<li>What do you think they used the pebbles for?</li>
							<li>Why do you think they painted on the pebbles?</li>
							<li>What do you think the paintings on the pebbles signified?</li>
						</ul>

						<p>Step 3: Hand out materials and let children paint their pebbles.</p>
						<p>Closure: Let students get into groups of four or five to share what they have painted and what the pictures mean to them. Display the pebbles in the room for a week or more so that the whole class can enjoy them.</p>
						
					<p><strong>Extension Activities:</strong> </p>
						<ul class="bulleted">
							<li>Make your own paint by grinding the pigment from clay, berries, or non-toxic charcoal (not charcoal briquettes) and mixing the pigment with water, egg white, or vegetable oil. </li>
							<li>The student may apply the paint with sticks or leaves for a more realistic example of the way painted pebbles were made.</li>
							<li>Visit <a href="/pecos/everyday.html" target="_blank">www.texasbeyondhistory.net/pecos/everyday.html</a> to view painted pebbles and other fascinating objects from the Lower Pecos Canyonlands region of Texas.</li>
