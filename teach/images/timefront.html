					<p><strong>Materials:</strong><br>
					<ul class="bulleted">
						<li>Internet access for: <a href="https://www.texasbeyondhistory.net/forts/36-44.html" target="_blank">https://www.texasbeyondhistory.net/forts/36-44.html</a></li>
						<li>computers</li>
						<li>paper</li>
						<li>colored markers/pens/pencils</li>
						<li>event and date cards for extension activities (included)</li>
					</ul>
					<p><strong>Activities and Procedures:</strong></p>
					<p>Step 1: Students can work in pairs or individually at the computer to access: <a href="https://www.texasbeyondhistory.net/forts/36-44.html" target="_blank">https://www.texasbeyondhistory.net/forts/36-44.html</a> website.</p>
					<p>Step 2: Students construct an illustrated timeline with the following dates: 1836, 1845, 1848, 1854, 1861, 1866, 1872, 1879, 1882. Students choose one event for each year and illustrate it on the timeline. </p>
					<p>Step 3/<em>Closure</em>: Students share their timelines with the class, explaining why they selected certain events.</p>

					<p><strong>Extension Activities, Alternate Closure, or Assessment</strong></p>
					<p>1. Card Sort. Divide students into groups of 3-4.  Create enough sets of cards so that each group has one set.  Give each group the entire set of cards, or only specific cards from the stack at teacher discretion.  Let them know that some dates may have more than one event card that corresponds to it.</p>
					<p>2. Have group members work together or individually to match the date cards to the event cards and put them in order. If students choose to work one at a time, have one group member act as timer, one as 'checker', and allow other students in the group to be a "lifeline" to offer advice if the student arranging the cards gets stuck.  If students in the group choose to work together, the teacher or another appointed student will need to check the accuracy of the cards.</p>
					<p>3. Compete to see which student or groups can match the date cards to the event cards the quickest.</p>
					<p>4. To increase difficulty and engagement, the teacher may walk around the room and add additional cards to the group's set.</p>
					<p>5. Cards may also be used to play "memory", or event cards may be arranged in the proper historical order without matching to the date cards.  Cards may be added or removed to match what has been learned in class or to increase or decrease difficulty.</p>
					<p>6. Have students learn more about the Red River War at: <a href="https://www.texasbeyondhistory.net/redriver/index.html" target="_blank">https://www.texasbeyondhistory.net/redriver/index.html</a> </p>
