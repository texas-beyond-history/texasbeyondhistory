					<p><strong>Activities and Procedures:</strong></p>
					<p>Step 1: Introduce students to Ransom and Sarah Williams, two former slaves, who after the Civil War purchased a 45-acre farm in Travis County. The Williams family lived on the farm from 1871-1905. From 2007-2009, archeologists investigated the former Williams farmstead and collected thousands of artifacts. Historians examined historical archives searching for documents that would give clues as to what it was like for African Americans to live in Travis County from Reconstruction through the turn of the century. Important sources of information were newspapers published by and targeting African Americans.</p>
					<p>Step 2: (Optional) Have students examine the main page of the <em>Ransom and Sarah Williams Farmstead</em> exhibit at Texas Beyond History: <a href="https://texasbeyondhistory.net/ransom/" target="_blank">https://texasbeyondhistory.net/ransom/</a></p>
					<p>Step 3: Have students read the Background Article and complete the questions. Discuss responses with the class. Explain to the class that students will be using examples primary source newspapers to answer the question, "How did newspapers published by black Texans around the turn of the 20th century strive to improve the lives of African Americans living in Travis County?"  Students will write a 5-paragraph essay using text evidence from the articles.</p>
					<p>Step 4: In groups or individually, have students read each document and complete the questions.  (Teachers may only assign certain documents to decrease the amount of time spent on the lesson.)  Instruct students to choose the best three articles that will help them answer the main question, "How did newspapers published by black Texans around the turn of the 20th century strive to improve the lives of African Americans living in Travis County?"</p>
					<p>Step 5: Have students complete the Outline to help them prepare for the essay.</p>
					<p>Step 6: Students use primary source documents, questions and answers, and outlines to write a 5-paragraph essay that answers the question: "How did newspapers published by black Texans around the turn of the 20th century strive to improve the lives of African Americans living in Travis County?"</p>
					<p><em>Student Product:</em> Completed documents, Outline, Essay.</p>
					<p><em>Closure:</em> Have students read essays.  Discuss what obstacles African Americans newspapers faced in Travis County around the turn of the century.</p>

					<p><strong>Extension Activities:</strong> Have students use the information on the <em>Ransom and Sarah Williams Farmstead</em> page to write a feature article about the couple that might have appeared in an African American newspaper from the time. Include advertisements and editorials that are time-period appropriate.</p>
					<p><strong>Assessment:</strong> Completed documents and essay.</p>
