Immigration to Texas in the 18th Century: The Journey of Mar&iacute;a Jesusita Curbelo-Delgado Smith's Canary Island Ancestors 
	<p class="text"><strong> Subjects:</strong> Texas, American, or World History  </p>
      <p class="text"><strong> Grade level: </strong>TEKS are provided for 7th grade but can easily be adapted for grades  8, 10, or 11.</p>
      <p class="text"><strong> Introductions:</strong><br>
     Working cooperatively, students will analyze maps tracing the immigration route of Mar&iacute;a's ancestors from the Canary Islands to San Antonio, Texas in the 1730s. They will then use their research to write a comparison/contrast essay examining travel in the 18th century and that of today.

<p><strong>Direction for the teacher:</strong>
<ul type="disc">
	<li><strong>Day 1</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Project the image of Mar&iacute;a Jesusita Curbelo-Delgado for students to see. Ask students to make observations about Mar&iacute;a, e.g., how old she looks, when this photo might have been taken. Ask students to explain their answers.</li>
	<li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Explain that Mar&iacute;a Jesusita Curbelo-Delgado was the descendent of immigrants who came to Texas in the 18th century. They voluntarily traveled all the way from the Canary Islands (part of Spain, off the coast of Africa) to settle in San Antonio, Texas. Using a computer and projector, open www.googlemaps.com and find the Canary Islands on the map. Zoom out on the map until the United States is also visible. Ask students if any of them have ever traveled across an ocean to another country and if so, how did they travel?</li>
	<li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Ask students to brainstorm some personal characteristics people would need to undertake an immigration journey at any point in time (e.g., bravery, strength, determination, curiosity, etc.). Explain that the Canary Islanders whose ancestors made this 18th century journey are very proud of their immigration history and have formed an organization to preserve their grou's history (<a href="https://cida-sa.org" target="_blank">cida-sa.org</a>). Explain that today students will look at some maps to explore the journey Mar&iacute;a's immigrant ancestors made from the Canary Islands to San Antonio. Have students choose a partner to work with. </li>
	<li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Graphic Organizer: Distribute one copy of the graphic organizer (Comparing and Contrasting: Travel from the Canary Islands to San Antonio, Texas – 18th Century and Today) to each student. Project an image of the graphic organizer and read through it with students. Explain that some of the information on the organizer will be filled in as a class, and some by students and their partners working together.</li>
	<li><strong>Step 5:</strong> Work with students to find a map application that allows measuring of travel time and travel distance between two points on a map. Google Maps (<a href="https://www.google.com/maps" target="_blank">google.com/maps</a>) is a good one.</li>
	<li><strong>Step 6:</strong> Transportation: Ask students how they think the immigrants traveled to North America. Show the image of an 18th century sailing ship and discuss what traveling on such a vessel must have been like, pros and cons. Have students fill in the first part of Transportation (18th Century) on their graphic organizer. Display the image of the map from Veracruz, Mexico to San Antonio, Texas. Ask students how these immigrants must have traveled from Veracruz, Mexico to San Antonio when there were no cars, buses, trains, or planes available. Answer: Explain that they had some horses, mules, and cattle, but mostly, they walked. Have them fill that in on the second part of Transportation (18th Century) on their graphic organizer.</li>
	<li><strong>Step 7:</strong> Travel Time: Explain that according to historic records, 56 immigrants, including Mar&iacute;a's ancestors, left the Canary Islands, headed for San Antonio, Texas on March 15, 1730. Have them fill in that date on their graphic organizer in the Travel Time (18th Century) section. Refer again to the map from Veracruz, Mexico to San Antonio, Texas and have students fill in the correct dates in the Travel Time (18th Century) section. Ask students what the most efficient way to travel from the Canary Islands to San Antonio, Texas would be today (answer: airplane). In the Travel Time (Today) section, have students fill in today's date. On their computers, have students determine the travel time between Canary Islands and San Antonio and fill it in on their graphic organizer. Note: Travel time would have been around 15 hours, but answers may vary slightly, due to differences in websites used by students.</li>
	<li><strong>Step 8:</strong> Travel Distance: On their computers, have students determine the distance the Canary Islanders had to travel from point to point. Note: Travel distances will be approximate, as measurement applications vary and measure in straight lines. </li>
	<li><strong>Step 9:</strong> Working with their partners, have students use all the information on their graphic organizers to help them imagine the best and worst parts of this trip in both time periods. Have them fill in their imagined answers on the organizer. Ask for several volunteers to share their answers.</li>
	<li><strong>Step 10:</strong> Lesson Summary: Ask students what elements of world travel have changed the most since Mar&iacute;a's ancestors left the Canary Islands in 1730. Point out that in the 18th century, taking a voyage across the ocean meant saying goodbye to loved ones, potentially forever.</li>
	
    <li><strong>Day 2</strong></li>   
	<li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Have students get with their partners and take out the graphic organizers they completed yesterday. Have them read over the information they gathered, then ask if anyone would prefer to have made the journey in the 18th century, rather than today. Have them explain their answers. Point out that Mar&iacute;a Jesusita Curbelo Delgado is a direct descendant of the people who made this trip, as are many who still live in San Antonio today.</li>
	<li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Explain that students will use the information on their graphic organizers to write an essay comparing and contrasting immigration travel in the 18th century to travel today. Go over the procedures for writing a comparison/contrast essay with students. If needed, use online instructions for writing a comparison/contrast essay.
