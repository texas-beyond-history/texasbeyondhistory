					<p><strong>Materials:</strong><br></p>
					<ul class="bulleted">
						<li>Computer access for: <a href="/kids/caddo" target="_blank">www.texasbeyondhistory.net/kids/caddo</a></li>
						<li>Student Handout sheet (included)</li>
						<li>Circle handouts (included) or plain paper</li>
						<li>Pens or pencils</li>
						<li>Colored markers</li>
						<li>Scissors</li>

						<li>Rulers (optional)</li>
					</ul>
					<p><strong>Activities and Procedures:</strong></p>
						<p>Step 1: Students work individually or in pairs. Each student or pair draws a circle approximately eight inches in diameter on each of six sheets of plain paper or teacher can print circle handout provided below. Students cut out all the circles to use for the book. </p>
						<p>Step 2: Students read one section about the Caddo at a time and perform the appropriate task from the Student Handout Sheet on one circle of paper. Use one circle for each task. Repeat until all five sections are complete. The tasks can be done in any order. </p>
						<p>Step 3: Students make a cover sheet on a separate paper circle with their name, the title “Caddo Indians,” and a drawing to illustrate Caddo life.</p>
						<p>Step 4: Students staple all six completed pages together to form a book.</p>
						<p>Closure: Students share their writing and drawings with the class, then take the book home to share with family.</p>
					<p><strong>Modification:</strong> Fewer vocabulary words can be required; the writing assignment can be shortened; fewer math problems can be required, or they can be omitted.</p>
					<p><strong>Extension Activities:</strong> Students can create more pages for the book by reading the full Caddo exhibit on Texas Beyond History (<a href="/tejas/index.html" target="_blank">www.texasbeyondhistory.net/tejas/index.html</a>), adding more drawings, poems, stories, and other products for each section as they wish.</p>
					<p><strong>Assessment:</strong> Completed circle book with proper use of vocabulary, grammar, and correct mathematics.</p>
