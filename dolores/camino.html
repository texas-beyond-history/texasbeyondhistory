          <td width="480" height="1343" valign="top"><p><EM>El Camino Real de los Tejas</EM>, or the Royal Road to the land of the   Tejas Indians, was the name given to the eighteenth-century transportation   corridor which connected the easternmost portions of the Province of Texas to   the seat of Spanish royal authority in New Spain&mdash;Mexico City. In fact, any road   that made a connection to a focal point near the edge of the Spanish borderlands   was called a royal road, and as a result there was more than one royal road.   Another notable example is<EM> El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro</EM>, the road   from Mexico City to Santa Fe.</p>
            <p>Unlike modern highways, the royal road was not a single line across the   landscape, but rather a corridor within which there were various transportation   features &ndash; such as main trails, secondary trails, bypasses, river crossings, and   stopping places. Designated a National Historic Trail in 2004, <EM>El Camino   Real de los Tejas</EM>&nbsp;once connected Spanish missions and posts, from Mexico   City to Los Adaes, the 18th century provincial capital of Texas. Early Spanish   explorers and expeditions followed established Indian trails and trade routes   which formed the backbone of the royal road. Through time new trails and   alternative routes were added, creating a net-like transportation corridor. As   expressed on the National Park Service's <A href="http://www.nps.gov/elte/historyculture/" target="_blank">El Camino Real de   los Tejas</A> web page, &ldquo;the road&rsquo;s development had irreversible impacts on the   native people of Texas and Louisiana. It linked unconnected cultural and   linguistic groups, and served as an agent for cultural diffusion, biological   exchange, and communication.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>In the piney woods of East Texas, James Corbin and Jeff Williams rank as the   primary researchers of the Camino Real. Corbin published in the groundbreaking   volume edited by Al McGraw, John Clark, and Elizabeth Robbins entitled, <EM>A   Texas Legacy: The Old San Antonio Road and the Caminos Reales, A Tricentennial   History, 1691-1991</EM>. &nbsp;Williams&rsquo; 2007 master&rsquo;s thesis on the subject stands   as the most comprehensive work on the subject to date. In spring 2008, Williams   identified a swale at Mission Dolores, which makes Mission Dolores the third   public area in Texas which has a remnant of El Camino Real de los Tejas that   visitors can experience firsthand&mdash;the other sites being Mission Tejas State Park   &nbsp;and Caddo Mounds State Historic Site.</p>
            <p>The swale or rut discovered at Mission Dolores in 2008 is a lingering   physical trace of an old road that was created by many travelers over a long   period of time. Worn into the ground, the swale is a shallow-to-deep U shaped   linear depression created by heavy carts or wagons pulled by draft animals like   oxen or mules. The swale at Mission Dolores lines up with Feature 65 discovered   by Corbin in 1978, which he identified as a portion of the Camino Real based on   land survey research that puts the feature in the correct location and by it   being a shallow flat-bottomed depression. Swales from the Camino Real have been   located and identified in several other places within the City of San Augustine   as well as in surrounding counties. The old road, with many segments yet to be   discovered, has left its imprint from the passage of countless travelers. </p>
            <p>Numerous expeditions passed through Mission Dolores while traveling along <EM>El Camino de los Tejas</EM> between 1721 and 1773. The major expeditions are   well documented and have been summarized by William C. Foster&rsquo;s <EM>Spanish   Expeditions into Texas, 1689-1768</EM>, but the accounts of unofficial travelers   have far less documentation. One exception is the account of a young Frenchman   named Pierre Marie Fran&ccedil;ois de Pag&eacute;s, who passed through Mission Dolores several   times in 1768 as he went back and forth between Los Adaes and the mission for   the Nacogdoches as part of his trip around the world.</p>
            <p>The narrative of Pag&eacute;s&rsquo; trip was published in English in an enlarged three   volume version in 1793. His comments are a firsthand account of what travel was   like in 18th century Texas. Upon his arrival at Los Adaes, the governor was said   to be at Mission Guadalupe for the Nacogdoches Indians. Pag&eacute;s traveled with a   guide to Mission Guadalupe, passing through Mission Dolores, and when he   realized that no provisions were to be had in Mission Guadalupe, he returned to   Adaes to procure them. Pag&eacute;s traveled alone back to Los Adaes&mdash;something not   recommended in those days. On the second day of this trip&mdash;probably somewhere   between the Attoyac River and Mission Dolores&mdash;Pag&eacute;s had two encounters with the   local Indians. Starting the second day of this trip before sunrise, Pag&eacute;s lost   the trail and almost walked into an Indian village. </p>

              <p align="left"><EM>I wandered into a beaten path, which led directly to a savage   village; happily, however, I recognized it through the trees by the round and   conical form of their huts; and, in all probability, I owed my escape to   Providence, and the obscurity of the morning; for had the savages chanced to be   awake, presuming under the first impulse of surprise, that I came as a spy or   robber, they would undoubtedly have fired upon me. &nbsp;</EM>&ndash; Pag&eacute;s   1793:66</p>
            </BLOCKQUOTE>
            <p>Later on that same day, Pag&eacute;s encountered a group of Indians &mdash;probably Ais   Indians&mdash;on the trail. </p>
            <BLOCKQUOTE>
              <p><EM>The same day I observed a party of natives before me, when that   involuntary fear of them entertained by Europeans, which I had not been able to   overcome, prompted me to skulk from the path, with a view to dine, as well as to   avoid their company. The moment, however, I alighted from my mule, I was   accosted by a couple of their women, who requested I would supply them with some   Indian corn, and I very readily shared with them what little I had. But the   reader may guess my surprise, when some time after they returned to testify   their gratitude, by making me a present of cakes made of wild fruit. I   afterwards fell in with men of the same village, from whom I received much   kindness; they were at great pains to put me in the best path, and to instruct   me what stages were most convenient for feeding my mule, as well as for my own   accommodation. </EM>&ndash; Pag&eacute;s 1793:66-67</p>
            </BLOCKQUOTE>
            <p>It&rsquo;s interesting that Pag&eacute;s wrote more of his encounters with the Indians   around Mission Dolores than the residents of Mission Dolores. All he says about   Mission Dolores itself is that he passed through there. It appears that Pag&eacute;s   chose not to stay at Mission Dolores. He spent the night of the second day of   his journey alone in the woods and when he awoke during the night to move his   mule to another pasture, he found that his mule was gone. </p>
            <BLOCKQUOTE>
              <p><EM>What a dismal prospect now opened to my mind! I had lost my mule, was in   the midst of an immense forest, without provisions, and without arms either to   procure subsistence, or to defend my life against an enemy. I cast a melancholy   look at my bear-skins and saddle, which served me for a bed and pillow; under   the terror of losing myself in the woods, almost trembled at the thoughts of   venturing forth in search of my companion. Necessity, however, at last prevailed   over my fears; and collecting all my courage and presence of mind, after   conjecturing from the moon&rsquo;s situation the direction of the path, I rushed into   the woods. Luckily I found my mule in the space of half an hour, grazing on the   sloping bank of a rivulet, which afforded him good pasture; but by what means he   was to be caught I knew not, and this excited new cause of disquietude. I can   say truly, that here, as in other trying situations, my temper never forsook me;   and after various fruitless efforts, I at length got hold of   him.</EM><BR>
