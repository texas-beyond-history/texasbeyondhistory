These coloring pages highlight several motifs, or design patterns, and show you how they think the paint was applied based on our research as well as other fun facts about the art. </p>

              <br> Did you know that archeologists often work for the National Park Service (NPS)? That&acute;s right&mdash;National Parks contain traces of people who lived there before they were parks! Some of them were even made into parks BECAUSE of the people who lived there in the past, and left behind fascinating traces of their lives. This NPS site was made just for you&mdash;kids who want to learn more about archeology in the parks! We especially like the Junior Archeologist booklet you can print out, in English and Espa&ntilde;ol!
