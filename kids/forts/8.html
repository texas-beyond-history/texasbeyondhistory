	   <meta name="description" content="Attention, Kids! I'm Major Dirt, a U.S. Army officer. Join Major Dr. Dirt, the Armadillo Archeologist, as they travel way back in time to visit a real Army fort from the 1870s and a rip-roaring Texas town called The Flat! You'll meet cowboys, soldiers, buffalo hunters, Indian scouts, and a little girl named Sallie who grew up on the west Texas frontier. You'll check in at the Tonkawa Indian village, too, in this Kids' game.">

					  </figure>
					<h2>Soldier, a moment please. Would you tell us what brings you to Fort Griffin?</h2>
				
					<p><strong>10th Cavalry Buffalo Soldier answers:</strong></p>
					<p>Pardon, sir, but I don't have much time to talk. Got to stable 
    my horse and get some things in town for General Sherman.</p>

					<p>We'll be heading on out in the morning, probably early, bound 
    for Fort Richardson. We've been escorting the general all across West Texas…Fort 
    Mason, McKavett, Concho. We've come all the way from San Antone with the general, 
    all of us from the Tenth Cavalry. We were all picked special for this trip.</p>

					<p>Spent 
    some time talking with the boys from the Ninth here at Fort Griffin. They're 
    all like us…colored troops. Listening to them, sounds like they been used 
    pretty hard down here. I think maybe we've been lucky. We've been up in the 
    Indian Territories, 'cross the Red River. Don't see so many of those old rebel 
    rascals as they got down here in Texas.</p>

					
					<p>I don't mean to say we've had no hard duty up there. I've 
    pitched my tent in three foot of snow in the wintertime. Been under summer 
    sun so hot I was seeing stars in the middle of the day. Marched three days 
    and nights with just a pint of water and half a pound of bread.</p>

					</figure>
						
					<p>Up in the Territories, that's where the Cheyenne Indians 
    took to calling us "Buffalo Soldiers." Boys in the regiment kinda like it, 
    take it as a sign of respect. Boys in the Ninth like the sound of it too.</p>
			
					
					
    <p>Lots of us boys, Tenth and Ninth both, hail from back in 
    Kentucky. I was just 18 when I joined up, over near Lexington. Liked the idea 
    of being around horses, been around 'em since I was little back in the slavery 
    times. Been in the regiment four years now, got one more year left on my time 
    to do.</p>

						<p>I reckon most of the boys is going to stay with the Army 
    when their time runs. We maybe don't get too much respect from the officers 
    in the other regiments, sometimes not even from our own officers. They're 
    all white. But we got respect for ourselves, and we're getting respect for 
    our people. I tell you what, the white folks sit up and take notice when they 
    see the general of the whole United States Army guarded by colored troops.</p>	
					
					
					
						<p>Begging your pardon, sir, but I got to be taking my leave 
    now. I can't be keeping the captain waiting, or he'll have me in the guardhouse 
    for certain.</p>

    <p>Sergeant Emanuel Stance (second from left) and troopers 
    of the Ninth U.S. Cavalry battle Apache Indians north of Fort McKavett in 
    1870. For his valor, Sergeant Stance was awarded the Medal of Honor, the first 
    given to an African-American soldier.</p>

	<p>Many 
    Black troops served on the Texas Frontier, including the Ninth and Tenth Cavalry 
    and 24th and 25th Infantry. Many were newly freed slaves from the south who 
    viewed Army service as an opportunity for honorable work as well as a chance 
    to receive an education. With Army chaplains as instructors, the troops learned 
    to read and write for the first time. In addition to battling Indians, the 
    Buffalo Soldiers tracked outlaws, Mexican Revolutionaries, and cattle rustlers 
    and mapped large territories of the southwest. They provided protection to 
    crews building railroads and helped string hundreds of miles of telegraph 
    wire, opening new lines of communication across the West.</p>
