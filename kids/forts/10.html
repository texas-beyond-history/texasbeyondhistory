						  <img src="images/wounded.jpg" alt="Freighter on a stretcher on a horse">
					  </figure>
					<h2>Whoa, there....you, lying in bed on the horse! It looks like you've found a mighty easy way to  travel, although you look a mite pale. What brings you here to Fort Griffin?</h2>
				
					<p><strong>Wounded freighter (on stretcher) answers:</strong></p>
					<p>I'm here to see the post surgeon. It's my leg. See? It's 
    broken. The bloody bone's poking clear through the skin.</p>
				
					<p>My name's Big Ollie. That fellow walking behind me is my 
    partner, Jos√©. We're freighters. For two weeks, we've been camped west of 
    here, way up California Creek, just south of Double Mountain. In case you 
    haven't heard, there's a mighty big buffalo kill going on over there.</p>

					<p>I 
    bet there are a good 1,000&#151;no, make that 2,000&#151;hunting outfits camped 
    on that prairie right now.</p>

					<figure class="gallery-img gallery-img-third-size img-right">
							<img src="images/sign.jpg" alt="photo of sign on a post">
					</figure>
					<p>Being freighters means that Jos&eacute; and I don't kill 
    or skin the buffs. We leave that to the shooters and skinners. After the hides 
    are stretched and dried, we pile 'em into our wagon and haul 'em to the hide 
    yard in The Flat </i>[the town outside Ft. Griffin]<i> to sell. At the hide 
    yard, a buyer inspects and weighs the hides and pays us. Then we head back 
    to camp for another load.</p>

					<figure class="gallery-img gallery-img-third-size img-left" id="house">
						<a href="images/house.html">
							<img src="images/house.jpg" alt="photo of Ledbetter's cabin"></a>
					</figure>
						
					<p>That's 
    the way our trips are supposed to turn out, except, this time, we got to The 
    Flat with no hides to sell. The Indians saw to that.</p>
					
					
    <p>Here's what happened: Jos√© and I were hauling a load of 
    hides&#151;about 350, I reckon&#151;to sell at the Flat. They were clean hides, 
    too, with hardly any cuts. We were expecting to be paid top dollar&#151;our 
    best haul, so far. Anyway, back to the story. Yesterday morning, we left California 
    Creek, traveled all day, and made camp for the night on this side of the Clear 
    Fork. We slept well and were ready to roll this morning at first light. Jos√© 
    was driving the mule wagon and I was riding my horse. We were thinking about 
    how much money we might get for those hides.</p>


			<figure class="gallery-img gallery-img-third-size img-left">
						<img src="images/cannon-sm.jpg" alt="photo of cannon">
					</figure>
						<p>We 
    were within two miles of town when 35 Indians came descending upon us on horseback. 
    They shot and killed our mules. That overturned the wagon, pitching Jos√© onto 
    his backside. At the sound of rifle fire, my horse spooked and reared up, 
    its hoof coming down on a loose slab of rock. The rock gave way. My horse 
    stumbled. Threw me to the ground and I broke my leg.</p>	

					<p>Jos√© 
    and I scrambled for cover behind the wagon. We fought for our lives. We fought 
    until all our cartridges were gone. Then we were like sitting ducks, an easy 
    target for the Indians. The warriors came down upon us like demons, taking 
    everything we had out of our wagons, and placing it in a heap. They stacked 
    all our beautiful hides on the ground and cut them to pieces. Then they began 
    their wild war dance all around. We sat there, quiet, waiting for the worst.</p>
					
				<p>Just 
    when we thought the end was near we heard the tramp of horses on a charge. 
    We looked into the distance to see about twenty of the Tenth U.S. Cavalry, 
    Captain Lee's company, thundering to our aid. A scout patrol had discovered 
    us. The soldiers fired upon the Indians, rounding them up, before coming to 
    where we were.  I wept like a baby at my deliverance.</p>
				
		<p>These two men carrying the stretcher were detailed to see 
    us safely to the post. We have arrived safely&#151;although we've lost everything 
    we had.</p>
				
				<p>I sure hope the post surgeon can help me. They have a small 
    hospital here, not as big as the one over at Fort Richardson. But I hear they 
    both have some mighty fine medicine that will keep me from getting gangrene 
    and maybe losing my leg!</p>

			<p><strong>Frontier 
    Medicine</strong> </p>
				
         <p>The fort doctor, or post surgeon, played an important role on the frontier, 
    for soldiers and civilians alike. Often, there were no other medical facilities 
    available. Each morning, sick call was sounded by the post bugler, signaling 
    all soldiers who felt poorly to report to the doctor's offices. Wounded or 
    sick settlers, cowboys, hunters, and freighters also made their way to the 
    fort to try the Army's brand of medicine. Although the Army's cure rate was 
    not high, anesthesia was generally available to help make surgery and amputations 
    less painful. The doctors also learned to treat some of the more common illnesses&#151;such 
    as scurvy&#151;by adding fruits or vegetables to the soldiers' diets. Sometimes, 
    this meant a pickle was added to the standard meal of beef, beans, and bread. </p>
