	   <meta name="description" content="Attention, Kids! I'm Major Dirt, a U.S. Army officer. Join Major Dr. Dirt, the Armadillo Archeologist, as they travel way back in time to visit a real Army fort from the 1870s and a rip-roaring Texas town called The Flat! You'll meet cowboys, soldiers, buffalo hunters, Indian scouts, and a little girl named Sallie who grew up on the west Texas frontier. You'll check in at the Tonkawa Indian village, too, in this Kids' game.">

					<p><strong>Question by Frontier Reporter, Early September 1872:</strong></p>
					<figure class="gallery-img gallery-img-half-size img-right">
						  <img src="images/rachelfoley.jpg" alt="Rachel Foley, her daughter, dog and a friend">
					  </figure>
					<h2>Ahem....I 
    hate to interrupt you fine ladies, but what brings you and your little baby 
    here to Fort Griffin, out on this frightening frontier?</h2>
					
					
					
					<p><strong>Rachel Foley, wife of Sgt. James 
    Foley, answers:</strong></p>
		
		
					<p>Because James is here, of course. James is my husband. He's 
    stationed here at the fort. He's Sergeant James Foley with the Fourth Cavalry. 
    He's not here right at the moment or I'd introduce you. James is out on a 
    scout, patrolling for Comanches that raided a nearby ranch. His regiment has 
    been gone for days, camped somewhere north of Collins Creek, I think.</p>
					
		<figure class="gallery-img gallery-img-third-size img-left" id="foleys">
						<a href="images/foleys.html">
							<img src="images/foleys-sm.jpg" alt="photo of Sgt. James and Rachel Foley"></a>
					</figure>
		
					<p>See that frame house behind me? That's where James, Bess, our baby girl, and I 
    live. Do you think I'm crazy to leave civilization behind and set up housekeeping 
    on a frontier army post? If you say yes, you won't be the first. A lot of my friends back home think 
    so, too. </p>
					
					
					
					<figure class="gallery-img gallery-img-third-size img-right" id="foleyhouse">

						<img src="images/foleyhouse-sm.jpg" alt="sketch of Foley house"></a>
					</figure>
					
					<p>"Texas is a hideout for savages and outlaws," said one of 
    my friends when she learned of our plan to move west. "A woman would have 
    to be stark raving mad to move out there," said another. Mad, perhaps, or 
    madly in love. I love my gallant soldier of a husband. I am willing to share 
    his fate, wherever or whatever it might be.</p>

					
					<figure class="gallery-img gallery-img-third-size img-right" id="baby">
						<a href="images/baby.html">
							<img src="images/baby-sm.jpg" alt="photo of the Foleys' child"></a>
					</figure>
					<p>There 
    was no doubt in either James' or my mind that the baby and I would make the 
    move with him. Before our departure, I was in high spirits and thrilled at 
    the thought of such adventure. But then I heard some discouraging news. I 
    learned that James was the only soldier in his regiment bringing along his 
    family. His fellow soldiers refused to subject their wives and children to 
    the hardships of frontier army life and were leaving them behind. I must admit 
    this cast a pall on my plans but I went forth anyway, resigning myself to 
    many lonely days of letter writing, mothering, and woman's work, as I knew 
    that James would be away on Indian campaigns much of the time we were to be 
    at Ft. Griffin.</p>	
					
					<figure class="gallery-img gallery-img-third-size img-left">
							<img src="images/eggs.jpg" alt="photo of eggs and flowers">
					</figure>
					
					
					
					<p>So you can imagine my relief when I arrived and discovered 
    other military women living at our new post. And, as if that wasn't blessing 
    enough, shortly after my arrival, two more women, pioneer ladies from local 
    ranches, came to call upon me. They, too, were extending to me the hand of 
    friendship (along with fresh eggs, butter, and two hens). Southerners welcoming 
    a Yankee to Texas! What joy to be among women again! I wasn't to be alone 
    after all.</p>
					
			<figure class="gallery-img gallery-img-half-size img-right" id="crocks">
						<a href="images/crocks.html">
					  <img src="images/crocks-sm.jpg" alt="photo of crocks"></a></figure>			
						
						
    <p>Now that the long heat of summer is past, we women look forward 
    to more time to enjoy one another's company. During these past hot days, though, 
    we haven't had time for leisure together. Being without ice, our entire summer 
    was occupied in keeping wet cloths around the jars that contain our milk and 
    butter. As the moisture from the cloths evaporates, it cools the dairy products 
    and keeps them from spoiling.</p>
						<figure class="gallery-img gallery-img-third-size img-left">
					  <img src="images/pies.jpg" alt="photo of pies">
					</figure>
						<p>Now, with the coolness of fall setting in, we women can once 
    more breathe freely and enjoy every pleasure. Our soldier husbands have been 
    away many of the past few weeks in a new effort led by Capt. MacKenzie to 
    drive the Kiowas and Comanches out of Texas and back to the reservation at 
    Fort Sill for good. So we women pass the days without them, visiting one another's 
    homes, sharing dinner or sitting on our shady vine-covered porches tending 
    our sewing and our children.</p>
		
		<figure class="gallery-img gallery-img-third-size img-right">
					  <img src="images/tarantula.jpg" alt="photo of a tarantula">
					</figure>
		
						<p>But 
    we have to be very watchful. The other day, for instance, I killed an ugly, 
    black, huge tarantula right inside our doorway! I picked up a basket and smashed 
    it hard. What would have happened if it had bit Little Bess?  It was Scout, our wonderful watchdog, who alerted me to the 
    insect's presence by barking. There are no windows in our house and it's beastly 
    hot in there. So we stay outside, often sleeping in hammocks strung across 
    the porch.</p>
						
			<figure class="gallery-img gallery-img-third-size img-right" id="book">
				<a href="images/book.html">
				<img src="images/book-sm.jpg" alt="photo of Godey's Ladies Book"></a>
					</figure>
    <p>If you have a moment longer, you can meet some of my friends. 
    They're due at my place any second now. I baked plum pies for their visit 
    and Mrs. Thompson is bringing her most recent Godey's Lady's Book to share 
    with us. Maybe someone will have received a letter from home she'll share.</p>
		<figure class="gallery-img gallery-img-third-size img-left">
					  <img src="images/cockroach.gif" alt="photo of a cockroach">
					</figure>
    <p>Life 
    on an army post is exceedingly trying. We have had to accustom ourselves to 
    fresh ways of living. We've weathered everything imaginable&#151;drought, 
    sandstorm, Indians, heat, dust, death, sickness, vermin of every kind&#151;wood-ticks, 
    flying roaches, wasps&#151;dried-up vegetables, indecent houses, and unsanitary 
    drinking water and facilities. Nevertheless, we cling to the refinements of 
    life, making our little houses as comfortable as we can. We give them the 
    woman's touch. I've added pretty, bright carpets to cover my dirt floors and 
    strung lace curtains across the kitchen windows.</p>
		
		<figure class="gallery-img gallery-img-third-size img-right" id="dog">
				<a href="images/dog.html">
				<img src="images/dog-sm.jpg" alt="photo of the Foley's dog, pipe in mouth"></a>
					</figure>
		<p>Oh, 
    my friends have hearts of gold and Bess is a dream of a child, never cross 
    except when she had the whooping cough last spring, but how I miss my funny 
    James. How he can make me laugh. Just before he left on patrol, we all went 
    down to the town, The Flat, they call it, and had our pictures made&#151;even 
    Scout, our Number One Dog. Since Scout saved us from the tarantula, we think 
    of him as a clever soldier&#151;guarding us from our foes. So James wanted 
    to honor his heroism. He dressed him up like a soldier, plopping a military 
    cap on his head and sticking a pipe in his mouth. You should have seen the 
    expression on that photographer's face when he learned he was to photograph 
    a dog&#151;and one in costume, too.</p>
		<p>Oh, James&#151;my precious, precious James. What a funny 
    man I'm married to. How happy he makes me. In all the West, there is no hardship 
    terrible enough to take away my special joy of life with James.</p>
