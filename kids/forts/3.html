					<h2>Hey there, Sergeant. I'd like a word with your passenger, please. Is that little Miss 
    Sallie Reynolds? What's a nice young girl like you doing here at Fort Griffin?</h2>

					<p><strong>Sallie Reynolds, age 7, answers:</strong></p>
					<p>"I go to school here at the fort. This is my teacher, Sergeant 
    Stackhouse. He's carrying me home to my ranch&#151;up on the Clear Fork. This 
    morning, I rode to school with my brother. We passed through the parade ground 
    when the soldiers were drilling&#151;my favorite time of day! I just love 
    to see the men in their fancy dress uniforms. I sit a little taller in the 
    saddle just seeing them in their blue coats, bayonets and brass buttons shining 
    like gold in the sunlight. They step along in time as the bugler blows the 
    notes. Do you know what? I can tell you what every single bugle call means. </p>
					
					<figure class="gallery-img gallery-img-third-size img-right">
							<img src="images/buckle.jpg" alt="photo of belt buckle found at Ft. Griffin">
					</figure>
					
					<p>I feel so much safer since the Army came to Ft. Griffin. 
    So does my family. Three months before the soldiers arrived, some Indians 
    stole our horses. My brother, George, took off after them and they shot him 
    in the stomach. George didn't die&#151;but 
    he could have. His United States Army belt buckle saved him. It kept that 
    arrow from going straight through his body. So we're glad the Army's near. 
    But not every rancher is happy to see Northerners in Texas. Some of the locals 
    hate anyone who wears the blue&#151;even though the War's been over almost 
    three years now.</p>

					<p>You 
    should see my school. Sergeant Stackhouse opened it in the south end of the 
    fort commissary, which is a warehouse for storing corn and flour and other 
    things the soldiers need. But to make it look more like a school, my teacher 
    went to a lot of trouble. Thanks 
    to him, we pupils sit on benches with seats and backs, with layers of clean 
    white sacks that make them softer. My teacher is a very nice man. He must 
    love teaching. Mother can't believe it. Here he is teaching almost forty children, 
    all different ages at the same time, and not charging any of us a" red cent." </p>

					</figure>
					<p>I 
    love living here on the frontier. We live on a big ranch, in a solid stone 
    house. Even the corrals are made of stone. I can see the hills beyond, and 
    the valley is covered in wildflowers in the spring. When we first moved there, 
    I was afraid. The house was in a shambles, with broken glass from the windows 
    lying on the floor. And there were tooth marks on the front door, where some 
    wild animal&#151;perhaps a wolf or a panther&#151;had gnawed on it. Now I 
    love to watch the animals here. There are deer and antelope, and some days, 
    great herds of buffalo&#151;those big shaggy beasts&#151;pass by.</p>

					<p>During 
    the War between the States, when the soldiers left, our family had to move 
    to a ranch further down the river called Fort Davis, for protection from the 
    Indians. There were about a hundred of us there, living in houses surrounded 
    by a wall. The men would sit on the wall to watch for Indians. Being there 
    with the other families made us feel safer, and we had some happy times. I'll 
    never forget the day we had the flag raising. I was chosen to carry the flag 
    in our parade. We marched around the fort as band music played. Then the men 
    fired three shots and raised the flag. Later, there was barbecue and dancing 
    all through the night.</p>

						<p><strong>School on the Texas Frontier</strong></p>
						
						<figure class="gallery-img gallery-img-third-size img-right">
					  <img src="images/primer.jpg" alt="photo of Ginn &amp; Co.'s A Primer">
					</figure>
						
    <p>During the Civil War, many Texas settlers moved to the protection of family 
    forts. Sallie Reynolds's family was one of those "forted-up" at 
    the family fort called Fort Davis. While there was not a school at Ft. Davis, 
    children met in a neighbor's home for Sunday school. There they read and discussed 
    the Bible and had a lesson from "Webster's 'Blue Back' Speller."</p>
						<figure class="gallery-img gallery-img-third-size img-left">
					  <img src="images/webster.jpg" alt="photo of the cover of &quot;Websters 'Blue Back' Speller&quot;">
					</figure>
						<p>After the war ended, Sallie's family moved to the Ft. Griffin area. With about 
    forty children from the post and neighborhood, Sallie 
    attended a real school on the army post. The teacher, a quartermaster sergeant, 
    opened the day with songs and a prayer. Singing songs to teach reading was 
    a popular method of teaching. Music was "simply a device to hold a child's 
    attention to his page and help to impress its words," according to Ginn & 
    Co.'s 1885 <em>A Primer</em>. As for religion, Sallie read the Bible regularly 
    from the time she was seven.</p>
						<p>Sallie's first teacher at Ft. Griffin turned out to be anything but a "nice 
    man." After teaching school two sessions, Sergeant Stackhouse disappeared 
    into the night&#151;with $25,000 of government money. In his flight east, 
    he stopped briefly at the Shaw home in Picketville to send this message back 
    to the fort: <em>"A swift team, a good buggy with wheels well greased; catch 
    me if you can."</em> Sergeant Stackhouse was never seen again.</p>

					<p><strong>Married Life</strong></p>
			<figure class="gallery-img gallery-img-third-size img-right">
					  <img src="images/ring.jpg" alt="photo of Sallie's wedding ring">
					</figure>
    <p>Like 
    other pioneer girls, Sallie Reynolds married young. At fifteen, she became 
    the bride of John Alexander Matthews, an old family friend and neighboring 
    rancher. Sallie and &quot;Bud&quot; planned to set up housekeeping at the 
    California Ranch in nearby Haskell County. After much preparation, the time 
    finally came for Sallie to leave her family home to begin a new life with 
    her husband. In her memoirs, she recalled that day:</p>
		<figure class="gallery-img gallery-img-third-size img-left">
					  <img src="images/sallieandjohn.jpg" alt="photo of Sallie Reynolds and John Matthews">
					</figure>
    <p><em>&#133;[W]e packed into a wagon our few belongings consisting of my little 
    organ, a Singer sewing machine, a bedstead with bedding and household linens 
    which were given to us by the two mothers, two or three trunks, and a pair 
    of pigs. We had a boy to drive the wagon and we started out in our buggy, 
    following the wagon. The day was bright and balmy, but my heart was sad and 
    heavy at leaving home for good. Up to now I had not realized what it meant 
    to tear loose from Mother and Father and make a separate home. I had been 
    very light-hearted while we were running back and forth between the two homes, 
    but this, this was different, and I could not keep the tears from flowing.</em></p>
