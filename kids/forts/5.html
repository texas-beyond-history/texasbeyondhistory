					<p><strong>Question by Frontier Reporter, January 1878:</strong></p>
					<figure class="gallery-img gallery-img-half-size img-right">
						  <img src="images/laundress.jpg" alt="illustrations of two laundresses with pots">
					  </figure>
					<h2>Oooo, 
    ouch...hot, hot! Pardon me, ma'am, for interrupting you, but can you tell us 
    what you do here at Fort Griffin?</h2>
					
					<p><strong>The Laundress answers:</strong></p>
					<p>Well, as anyone can see, I'm workin'&#151;and workin' hard&#151;stirring 
    these steaming pots. I work for the Army. I came out west to Ft. Griffin with 
    the 17th Infantry in May of 1868. I'm a washerwoman. I get paid to wash the 
    soldiers' clothes. That may not sound like very high and mighty work to some 
    people but, let me tell you, I earn my keep. Why, last July, my husband's 
    paycheck was only $13. Do you know what I brought in that same month? $40. 
    $40!</p>
					
					<figure class="gallery-img gallery-img-third-size img-left">
					  <img src="images/johns.jpg" alt="photo of longjohns">
					</figure>
					
					<p> That's just about what the head laundress here makes every month&#151;because 
    she mostly washes officers' clothes.</p>
					<p>I 
    charge each soldier by the piece. I'll wash anything&#151;undershirts, overshirts, 
    cotton and canvas pants&#151;even wash their unmentionables. It all adds up, 
    too, a nickel here, a dime there. And I do good work, too. I don't waste my 
    days lolling around, talking up the men, like some women I won't name.</p>	
					
					<figure class="gallery-img gallery-img-half-size img-right">
					  <img src="images/change.jpg" alt="photo of coins"></figure>
					
					<p>But the best part is that the Army sees that I get my pay. 
    Every month, the laundresses get to line up first at the pay table. We're 
    given our due even before the soldiers see their paycheck. </p>

					<p><strong>Recipe for Lye Soap</strong></p>
						<br>
					<p><em>11 pounds of hog grease <br>
						2 quarts of lye <br>
						7 gallons of water</em></p>
						<br>
					<p>Heat water in big heavy pot on fire. Add lye, being careful not to touch it. 
    Drop in grease and boil and stir for about 4 hours. Try out soap in small 
    saucer. If it's hard, take it off fire. Stir a chicken feather in it. If feather 
    gets cut, it's done. Pour out into flat pans and let set for
    about two weeks.</p> 
						<p>Cut into bars. Best to make it when the moon is right or it won't set right.</p>

					<p>Do you see those white canvas tents over yonder, on the far 
    edge of the post? That's where most of the laundresses live. Everybody calls <img src="images/tick.jpg" width="55" height="65" align="right" alt="photo of a tick"> 
    it "Suds Row." I lived there when I first came here. But once I got married, 
    my husband was allowed to move out of his barracks (that he shared with five 
    other men) and move into a new house with me. We now live in this cute little 
    frame house with its own kitchen. True, it's not much to look at on the inside, 
    but who has time to fix it up pretty?I'm up before the sun, keeping the fires 
    going under my pots all day so I keep the water boiling hot enough to kill all those wretched critters crawling on the 
    men's clothes. Fleas, lice, ticks, you name it; <img src="images/ticks2.jpg" width="19" height="23" align="absmiddle" alt="photo of a tiny tick">I've seen every kind of varmint in 
    this wild land. Every day but the Sabbath, I'm up and working&#151;soaping 
    and scrubbing and brushing and airing and hanging out clothes and mending 
    and sewing on buttons all the time having that hot sun blazing down on me. 
    And, on some days, if too many soldiers have ridden away from the fort on an Indian 
    campaign, I have to chop my own firewood. <img src="images/ticks3.jpg" width="19" height="23" align="absmiddle" alt="photo of tiny tick">At night, when I lay down to sleep, my shoulders 
    ache from carrying those thirty-pound buckets of water back and forth from 
    the creek thirty to forty times a day.</p>
					
					

<p>But 
    I'm not complaining. When my family first came to America from Ireland, I 
    couldn't find any work on the East Coast. Now, thanks to the United States 
    Army, I've got an important job, food to eat, a man to please, and a roof 
    over my head. No, I'm not complaining. I saw much worse misery when I was 
    back in Ireland.</p>

		<p>Although the Army depended heavily on the laundresses to keep soldiers' clothes 
    and bedding clean and free of bugs, the women generally were treated poorly. 
    They were usually housed in tents at the far edges of the fort, and some were 
    forced to sleep on the ground. At some forts, the women had to chop their 
    own firewood in addition to doing the many heavy loads of wash each day. Although 
    the pay was fair, the work was hot, exhausting, and dangerous. They worked 
    over vats of boiling water and scalding steam, and made strong lye soap that 
    could burn arms and hands. There are reports of laundresses burning to death 
    after their long skirts brushed too close to the fires.</p>
