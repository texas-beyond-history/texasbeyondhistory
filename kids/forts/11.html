					<p><strong>Question by Frontier Reporter, June 
    7, 1878:</strong></p>
					<figure class="gallery-img gallery-img-half-size img-right">
						  <img src="images/cowboys.jpg" alt="Dusty Cowboys herding cattle">
					  </figure>
					<h2>Howdy 
    there, boys. What brings you and your herd here to The Flat?</h2>
				
					<p><strong>Tall 
    Cowboy answers:</strong></p>
					
					<figure class="gallery-img gallery-img-third-size img-right">
						<img src="images/longhorn1.jpg" alt="photo of longhorn grazing">
					</figure>
					
					<p>Well, now, that's a story in itself. Me and my partners weren't 
    aiming to pass through Ft. Griffin and The Flat at all, not at all. Four weeks 
    ago, when our outfit left South Texas, we were planning on trailing our herd 
    north through Ft. Worth on the Chisholm Trail, like we did back in '76, on 
    the way to Kansas.</p>
				
					<figure class="gallery-img gallery-img-third-size img-left">
						<img src="images/map.gif" alt="map of Western Trail">
					</figure>
					
					<p>But, 
    this trip, we were forced to change trails at Belton. There we learned that, 
    up ahead toward Ft. Worth, the trail was blocked to cattle drivers. It seems 
    that, since the last time we went up the trail, farmers have taken over. They've 
    planted crops and aren't letting cows cross their land. So we had to abandon 
    the Old Chisholm Trail. We changed direction, pointing our cattle north up 
    the Leon River, toward Ft. Griffin.</p>
					
					<figure class="gallery-img gallery-img-half-size img-right" id="longhorn2">
							<a href="images/longhorn2.html"><img src="images/longhorn2.jpg" alt="photo of longhorns grazing near Ft. Griffin"></a>
					</figure>
							
					<p>Once 
    we got here at Griffin, we made a fine cow camp on the south bank of the Clear 
    Fork. We found plenty of rest and range for the cows and shade for the trail 
    hands. Tomorrow, after the cows are inspected, we'll cross the river and join 
    this new Western Trail. It'll guide us up through Indian Territory and into 
    Dodge City, Kansas, where we hope to sell our cattle. Otherwise, it's another 
    long haul all the way up to Montana.</p>
	
					
					
					
					
					<p>I like this town you've built. It's a wide-open kind of place. It seems like 
    a man could get anything he wanted here at The Flat, maybe even some decent 
    chow. A man gets tired of eating chuckwagon food. It's always the same old 
    thing&#151;beans, bacon, coffee, and biscuits, three meals a day&#151;every 
    day.</p>	
					
					<figure class="gallery-img gallery-img-half-size img-right" id="chuckwagon">

					</figure>
						
					<p>But before we haul off and find ourselves a fancy restaurant, 
    I have to go to the general store. My gloves are worn thin, cut clear through 
    in some places, from roping stray steers.</p>
					
					
    <p>I 
    can't buy an expensive pair here, though, because I don't have much money. 
    Trail hands get paid at the end of the trail. Once I get to Dodge, though, 
    I can buy a whole new outfit if I want, that is, if we can find a buyer there 
    for our beeves.</p>

					</figure>
				
						<p>After 
    I buy new gloves, Shorty wants to visit a barbershop for a shave and a haircut. 
    Then we'll head over to the photography studio so he can have picture made 
    while he's still gussied up.</p>	
				
	<figure class="gallery-img gallery-img-third-size img-left">
							<img src="images/saddlebag.jpg" alt="photo of old saddlebag">
					</figure>

					<p>By that time, we'll have worked up a good appetite. We'll 
    grab a bite and then it'll be time for our big blowout. That saloon across 
    the street seems a good place to start.</p>
				
	
					
				<p>Those piano tunes drifting through the saloon door are drawing us toward the 
    place like cows to water. After a few hands of poker and a toddy or two in 
    there, we'll be new men. After a month of 18-hour workdays, cowboys just have 
    to blow off some steam every now and again to shake off this blasted trail 
    dust.</p>
			<br><br>
					<figure class="gallery-img gallery-img-third-size img-right">
							<img src="images/spur.jpg" alt="photo of old spur">
					</figure>
	
				
		<p>Time's 
    a wasting. Before we know it, it'll be midnight and our turn for night duty. 
    Every cowpuncher is taking a shift watching the cows tonight. We always watch 
    them like hawks at night&#151;wolves, you know. But tonight we'll have to 
    keep an especially sharp eye out. This town is crawling with men so desperate 
    for money they'd rustle our cattle&#151;and right under the nose of the U.S. 
    Cavalry.</p>

							<a href="images/dust-nail.html"><img src="images/dust-nail-sm.jpg" alt="photo of cowboys herding in a dust storm"></a>
					</figure>
				
				<p>Enough talk&#151;it's time for action! Let's get going, Shorty. 
    So long for now. [He takes out his pistol and shoots it into the air three 
    times, throwing his head way back and laughing hard.] Yee-haw!</p>
