                  for miles along the wide Red River, the Neches, and the Sabine. The Caddo
                  people were farmers, hunters, builders, artists, traders, warriors, dancers,
                  and priests. They were fathers, and mothers, sisters, and brothers.</span>
               </p>
               <p class="text"><span class="red">Today, the Caddo have many of the same jobs,
                  talents, and skills, but they have adapted these to the modern, 21st-century
                  world.</span>

                  plow their fields with tractors rather than poke the ground with wooden digging
                  sticks. There are still Caddo warriors, but they wear the uniform of a policeman
                  or U.S. soldier rather than the face paint and feather robe of the warriors
                  hundreds of years ago. There are still Caddo builders, but they use table
                  saws and nail guns rather than stone tools and leather ropes to construct
                  their homes.</span> 
               </p>
               <p class="text"><span class="red">Today the Caddo are much like any other residents
                  of the United States, except for an important difference. The heritage of
                  the Caddo in Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, and Oklahoma goes back more than
                  1000 years! The Caddo people are proud of their long heritage and preserve
                  as much of it as they can, just as they have always done, by passing traditional
                  knowledge from tribal elders down to the younger generations.</span>
