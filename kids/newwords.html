				<p id="a"><strong><span class="orange-text">Alluvial Fan</span></strong> A fan-shaped deposit of sediment that forms where a stream drops downward from a higher elevation and encounters the valley floor. The stream slows down, depositing fine silt, sand, or other sediments it is carrying.</p>

				<p id="indian"><strong><span class="orange-text">American Indian</span></strong> Indian was the name mistakenly used by early European explorers for the <a href="#indigenous">indigenous</a> people living in North and South America. The explorers thought they had found India. But the mistake stuck and now the term <em>Indian</em> means &quot;Native American.&quot; Some Native Americans do not like the term <em>Indian</em>. Most American Indians or Native Americans actually prefer to be known by their tribal name, such as Caddo or Comanche.</p>
					
					<br>
					
				<p><strong><span class="orange-text">Archeology</span></strong> Scientific study of the human past through the things left behind by humans, including artifacts, remains of shelters or buildings, campsites, cooking areas, and other traces. Also spelled <strong>archaeology</strong>.</p>

          		</figure>
					
				<p id="arrowhead"><strong><span class="orange-text">Arrowhead</span></strong> An arrowhead is the same thing as an arrow point. It is the sharp tip of an arrow, the part that spears the target. In precontact times arrow points were made out of stone. In more recent times, most arrow points were made of metal. Arrowheads were attached to the end of a wooden or cane shaft, using strong fiber or leather cording and sometimes mastic (glue) to hold them in place.</p>
						
					<br>
					
				<p><strong><span class="orange-text">Artifact</span></strong> Something made or used by a person in the past, such as tools, containers, and weapons, as well as the bits and pieces (debris) left over from making these things. Archeologists often learn just as much from tiny, broken pieces as they do from whole artifacts. Even an animal bone is considered an artifact if it was used or modified by a human. Archeologists look for cut marks on bone, for instance, to show human use.</p>

          		</figure>
					
				<p><strong ><span class="orange-text">Association</span></strong> Archeological term used to describe objects found together. When artifacts or other objects are found together or close by, they are said to be "associated" or "found in association" with one another. This may mean that the items were used together. Bones, stones, charcoal, and ash found together (&quot;in association&quot;) may be the remains of a cooking hearth where meat was cooked.</p>	
					
					<br>
					
				<p><strong ><span class="orange-text">Atlatl</span></strong> Short, hand-held piece of wood used as a lever to &quot;throw&quot; or propel a dart or light spear. This is an Aztec word pronounced &quot;at-lat-til&quot; or &quot;at-til-lat-il&quot;. Atlatl technology predated bow and arrows, and were used around the world for thousands of years.</p>

					<br>
					
				<p><strong ><span class="orange-text">Buffalo</span></strong> Cow-like animal with a dark shaggy hide and short curved horns; also called bison. Millions of buffalo once roamed the Great Plains in the central part of North America. When white settlers moved into the area, hide-hunters used powerful rifles to kill thousands and thousands of buffalo. Within a few years, almost all the buffalo were gone (and in danger of becoming extinct). Fortunately, a few were saved by thoughtful ranchers. Today, the buffalo are becoming numerous again.</p>

					<br>
					
				<p id="c"><strong ><span class="orange-text">Cache</span></strong> A group of hidden items found in a tight cluster indicating they were intentionally buried or placed together. Native peoples sometimes buried caches of tools or weapons at campsites, perhaps to use on  future visits. They also placed caches of finely made items in the graves of loved ones.</p>	
					
					<br>
					
				<p id="chert"><strong ><span class="orange-text">Chert</span></strong> A type of sedimentary rock, also called &quot;flint.&quot; American Indians used chert to make stone tools such as dart points. Chert flakes and tools can be incredibly sharp.</p>
					
					<br>
					
				
				<p><strong ><span class="orange-text">Chronology</span></strong> A system used to organize events and other information in time, from earliest to latest, in a time line.  Archeologists develop cultural chronologies to help understand how cultures change through time.</p>

          		</figure>
					
				<p><strong ><span class="orange-text">Context</span></strong> An artifact's physical context is exactly where it is found within a site. After finding an artifact, it's very important to understand what the site's stratigraphy (layering of dirt and soil) is like and where other artifacts in the site are located.</p>

An example of American culture: we celebrate birthdays with parties, cakes, and candles. Some cultures don't!

				<p><strong><span class="orange-text">Hide tanning</span></strong> The process in which animal hide is converted into leather. American Indians  used this process in order to create longer-lasting, more durable clothing. The first step in this procedure was to remove the skin from the animal. After scraping away the remaining flesh and removing the hair, women set the hide in the sun to dry. To complete this operation the hide was treated with tannin, which made it softer, yet stronger. American Indians had several sources of tannin. The most commonly used source was campfire ashes which were mixed with water.</p>

				<p><strong><span class="orange-text">Hunting and Gathering</span></strong> A way of life in which people obtained food and all the other resources they needed directly from the land. For thousands of years, people hunted animals and gathered plants in the wild, instead of growing crops or raising animals such as cattle. They did not have grocery stores for food, or hardware stores for tools, like we do today. In some places people still practice a hunting and gathering lifestyle.</p>

				<p id="hypothesis"><strong><span class="orange-text">Hypothesis</span></strong> An educated guess used as a trial explanation. That means the hypothesis is used until the archeologist knows &quot;for sure&quot; that they are right (or at least pretty sure!). Remember, archeologists hardly ever know anything for sure. Instead, they just try to make really intelligent guesses about things that happened a very long time ago&#151;long before they were alive. So instead of making a wild guess, the archeologist is using knowledge and training to help make an educated or &quot;smart&quot; guess.</p>

				<p><strong><span class="orange-text">Pithouses</span></strong> Built by prehistoric people on the Texas plains, pithouses were very well suited for the plains environment, as they took advantage of the natural insulation provided by the earth. The first stage of building such a house was to dig a pit. A frame made of wood logs and branches would be built, and then the earth (dirt) dug out of the pit was often used to make the roof. Early pioneers in the Texas Panhandle built dugouts that were very similar to prehistoric pithouses.

Some famous historic sites you might know about are the Alamo, the shipwreck of the Belle, and Washington-on-the-Brazos (Texas' first capitol).</p>

				<p id="stratigraphy"><strong><span class="orange-text">Stratigraphy</span></strong> The study of the natural and cultural layers that make up an archeological site. Archeologists study these layers of deposits (soil and sediments) to understand the processes by which the site was formed, including flood deposits, ancient camp litter, and wind-blown sand. Generally, younger layers are deposited on top of older layers. In geology, stratigraphy is the study of layers of rock, including their geographic extent, age, classification, characteristics and formation.</p>
					
					<br>
					
				<p><strong ><span class="orange-text">Stratum</span></strong> (plural: strata) A distinct natural or human-made layer. For geologists, the textbook example of strata is successive horizontal layers of rock arranged like a layer cake. The strata that archeologists often encounter, however, are rarely so neat and often inclined, irregular, intermixed or otherwise challenging to trace. See <strong>Stratigraphy</strong> (above).</p>

				<p id="w"><strong><span class="orange-text">Wickiup</span></strong> A small, temporary shelter used by prehistoric peoples for camping. Made of tree branches and covered with bundles of grass or reeds, a wickiup (pronounced wicky-up) provided protection from the wind and rain and shade from the glaring sun. </p>
					
					<br>
					
				<p><strong><span class="orange-text">Winnow</span></strong> A method of separating seeds from dirt and other plant material, so that the seeds can be used as food. Plant materials were first placed in a flat basket or tray and then tossed gently in the air on a windy day. The lighter leaves and dust would be blown away, while the heavier seeds would drop back into the basket.</p>
