<h1>Prickly Pear <em>[Opuntia spp.]</em></h1>  
      <p> Although this widespread cactus is often considered a nuisance today,
        it was a critical natural resource for native peoples in the Plateaus
        and Canyonlands, serving as a year-round mainstay food resource, a medicinal
        plant, an essential earth-oven layer, and even as a container and floor
        covering in dusty caves. Prickly pear gets its name from its sharp spines
        and is seasonal fruits known as pears or <em>tunas</em>. The long, sharp
        spines (the prickly part of the name) are actually modified leaves that
        harden as they age. Technically, the plant&rsquo;s &ldquo;branches,&rdquo; known
        as pads or <em>nopales</em>, are succulent, evergreen stem segments.
        The fruit begins to ripen in midsummer to a deep red color and produces
        a very sweet, yet otherwise tasteless, purple-red juice. The <em>tunas</em> are
      harvested by many animals as well as people.</p>
      <p> Prickly pear was a major resource for native peoples and its importance
        to prehistoric life throughout the Plateaus and Canyonlands region and
        far beyond is often underappreciated. While it is widely known that the
        pears were mainstay seasonal resource from mid-summer to early fall,
        the plant was used in many other ways. The pads, when backed and removed
        of their spines, can be eaten year round &ndash; direct evidence from
        Hinds Cave coprolites (dried human feces) suggests that the pads themselves
        were a mainstay food. The pads were also critical components of earth
        oven cooking&mdash;they were used as green packing material providing
        steamy moisture and chemical compounds that helped bake lechuguilla and
        sotol. The pads could also be used as containers and even canteens. Prickly
        pear can also be used for many different medicinal purposes including
        treating burns, wounds, and diabetes. All in all, prickly pear ranks
        up there with lechuguilla as a critical natural resource, but it occurs
        naturally throughout the region.</p>
      <p class="fake" onClick="classChange(undisplayed,'DisplayBlock')">Details</p>
     <div class="DisplayNone" id="undisplayed">
      <p> The most common species of prickly pear is <em>Opuntia engelmannii</em>,
      which can grow into dense, shrubby clumps covering large tracts of land.
      This species and several close relatives favor well-drained rocky flats
      and slopes, but can grow practically anywhere. Livestock overgrazing, soil
      erosion, the cessation of range fires, and modern land clearing practices
      have caused prickly pear to spread widely and densely in areas that were
      once grassland savannas. In contrast to most types of cactus, prickly pear
      grows relatively quickly with adequate moisture and spreads easily; broken
      off stem segments readily take root and create whole plants.</p>
    <h2><strong><em> Tunas</em></strong>
    </h2>
    <p> Each prickly pear fruit contains about 50 seeds, and it is the hard and
      durable seed that is found at many archeological sites. It not only survives
      the fruit processing activities, but passes through the human gut unscathed.
      At Hinds Cave, prickly pear seed was present in some deposits at densities
      exceeding 90 seeds/liter, a strong indication that prickly pear fruit was
      one of the most common plant foods for the people who lived along the lower
      Pecos River. We also have more direct evidence that prickly pear was consumed
      in large quantities by the Hinds Cave inhabitants, because the seeds or
      fragments of the seeds were found in 74% of the coprolites (desiccated
      human feces) in one study, and 82% of the coprolites in another study! </p>
    <p><em> Tunas</em> are harvested by knocking or twisting the fruits off the
      pads into a basket. The stiff hairs that cover the fruits need to be removed
      before they are consumed, and this can be accomplished by parching the
      fruit in hot coals or rubbing off the hairs using a rock. The fruits can
      be eaten raw, or they can be pounded in a mortar and pestle. A wooden mortar
      and pestle discovered in a cave in northern Val Verde County had prickly
      pear seeds in the cracks (Collins and Hester 1968). These seeds were probably
      wedged into the cracks when the user was pounding prickly pear fruits into
      juice and pulp. The juice is separated and consumed, and the remaining
      pulp can be sun-dried and stored.</p>
    <p> Some early explorers learned the hard way that prickly pear tunas have
      to be processed carefully. The following advice is based on a historic
      prickly pear accident that occurred on Matagorda Island, as related by
      Henri Joutel, a survivor of La Salle&rsquo;s expedition to Texas in the
      late 17 th century:</p>
    <p> One must strip the fruit before eating it because, although the quills
      are quite small and almost imperceptible, without fail they make one sick
      once they lodge in the throat and on the roof of the mouth. One of our
      soldiers even died from having eaten the fig greedily without wiping it.
      All these quills caused tremendous inflammation of the throat and eventually
      suffocated him. (Foster 1998:124) </p>
    <h2><strong><em> Nopales</em></strong>
    </h2>
    <p> Prickly pear pads (green fleshy stems) were edible, and even used as
      containers. Both the immature pads (nopalitos) and the mature pads (nopales)
      were consumed by the foragers of the past. Although the immature pad can
      be eaten raw, the mature pad most likely was baked first.</p>
    <p> The most compelling archeological evidence that <em>nopales</em> were
      a dietary mainstay come from work at Hinds Cave. Fragments of the epidermis,
      or the outer skin, of the <em>nopal</em>, were identified in between 8%
      and 28% of the coprolites in one study, and 70% of the coprolites in another
      study from Hinds Cave (Stock 1983:65). Most of the Hinds Cave coprolites
      are also full of fibers, many of which may well be from nopales, but dietary
      fibers are so not easy to distinguish</p>
    <p> Although it is 55-85% water by weight , prickly pear fruit is rich in
      Vitamin C and calcium and is a good source of carbohydrates. The pads contain
      fewer carbohydrates but are rich in Vitamin A. Mature pads probably were
      baked in an earth oven before consumption, because they contain oxalic
      acid and calcium oxalate crystals. The grinding effect of calcium oxalate
      crystals have been implicated in the poor dentition of the Lower Pecos
      peoples. On the other hand, the immature pads or nopalitos can be consumed
      raw, and are rich in calcium and digestible fibers.</p>
    <p><strong> Warning</strong>: Please be aware of the fact that the immature
      pads of wild prickly pear cactus can have very small spines that cause
      inflammation of the tongue and throat. These must be removed carefully.
      It is smarter to buy the spineless, cultivated variety at the grocery store.
      Nopalitos are available in the fresh fruits and vegetables section of most
      grocery stores. <strong></strong>These cultivated nopalitos are grown from
      a spineless prickly pear variety originally developed by the famous plant
      breeder Luther Burbank.</p>
    <h2><strong> Native Accounts</strong><strong> </strong>
    </h2>
    <p> There are very few ethnohistoric accounts of the native use of prickly
      pear from Texas. The most famous is the great prickly pear harvest recorded
      by Cabeza de Vaca, the first European to cross Texas and write a first-hand
      report. In midsummer many different groups would converge on the area in
      southern Texas near Alice, Texas where prickly pear was ripening, and this
      was their favorite time of the year. They would squeeze the juice out of
      the fruit and dry the pulp and skin (Cabeza de Vaca 1983:80). </p>
    <p> Some of the more detailed ethnographic records of pear processing come
      from groups in the western U.S. that did not rely on the plant as a major
      food source, only as a seasonal supplement. Typical preparation of the
      fruit includes drying and pressing fruits in to a large flatcake, as done
      by the Yavapai. There are examples of the fruit being pit-baked, as is
      reported for the Cahuilla. The Cahuilla pick the fleshy young fruit of <em>Opuntia
      basilaris</em> in early summer and steam or bake it (Bean and Saubel 1972). <em>Opuntia
      engelmannii</em> fruit is very juicy and needs only to be pounded and sun-dried.
      Although there are no ethnographic references to pit-baking green or partially
      ripened<em> Opuntia engelmannii</em>, Phil Dering has pit-baked the green
      or partially fruit and found it to be palatable. </p>
    <h2><strong> Medicinal Uses</strong>
    </h2>
    <p> Prickly pear pads are also have very useful medicinal applications, and
      the dietary value of the immature pads, or <em>nopalitos</em>, is extremely
      important today for combating Type 2 (adult onset) diabetes. Here are some
      of the documented historic and modern uses of <em>nopales</em>.</p>
    <ul>
      <li> Infusion of pads used to treat urinary tract infections<strong></strong></li>
      <li> Mucilage (pulp) in raw nopalitos reduces rate of sugar absorption,
        hence they are effectively reduce symptoms of insulin shock </li>
      <li> Mature pads as poultice and antiseptic for wounds </li>
      <li> Mature pads to treat burns </li>
      <li> Tea made from pads for treating tuberculosis scar tissue </li>
      <li> Mucilage from mature pads kills bacteria in cultures, so it has antibiotic
        properties </li>
      <li> Hot poultice of prickly pear pad skin applied to boils </li>
      <li> Split pads used as a hemostat to stop bleeding </li>
      <li> Infusion of pads used to treat swollen prostate </li>
      <li> Pads are high in calcium, both insoluble calcium oxalate and soluble
        mucilage. They have a hypoglycemic effect, significantly lowering cholesterol
        and preventing glycemia. Soluble fibers, including viscous mucilage,
        inhibit the absorption of simple carbohydrates. Pads also contain high
        levels of amylose, a starch that breaks down into simple sugars more
        slowly than amylopectin, the starch in bread and potatoes. Mature pads,
        however, contain calcium oxalate crystals that are insoluble and may
        cause health problems. </li>
      <li> According to Laredo herbalist Tony Ramirez, nopales are useful in &quot; preventing
        diet-related cardiovascular disease and adult onset diabetes&quot; as
        well as protecting the male prostate gland. (Fowler 2001) </li>
