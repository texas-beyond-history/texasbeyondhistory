                        <p>About  650 years ago, native peoples established a camp  deep in the South Texas Plains overlooking  a 
					  small, slowly flowing stream.  First 
					  and foremost, the archeological evidence shows they were a hunting people who ranged out from the camp in search of  preferred prey, hoofed  animals: deer, antelope, and buffalo. But hunting big game animals was not what brought in most of the  food&#8212;they also gathered, picked, dug up, snared, hunted, and grabbed all manner of smaller creatures, plant foods, and other natural resources. </p>
                        <p> That the Hinojosa site 
					    represents a substantial and repeated encampment of women, children, and men, is shown by the diverse range of tools, ornaments, cooking features, and animal bones  they left behind. Many 
                          of their artifacts  are characteristic of the  <strong>Toyah culture</strong>, which 
                          spread across the Edwards Plateau of central Texas and deep into the South Texas 
                        Plains in the 14th century. Yet they were not immigrants who brought  new ideas and things from afar;   they were peoples who followed centuries-old ways  of life in  the South Texas Plains. </p>
                        <p>Here the story of the Hinjosa site is told in both broad stroke and gritty detail, 
						  arranged so you can learn as much or as little as you choose.  The exhibit tells the story, but the supporting archeological evidence and particulars  can be studied  by reading sections of the technical site report (follow the <img src="images/pdf-button.jpg" alt="Download pdf" width="19" height="20" align="absmiddle"> icons), and by looking at  
						  the enlarged images (follow the <a href="#icon" onMouseOut="MM_swapImgRestore()" onMouseOver="MM_swapImage('Image13','','images/camera-button-ro-sm.jpg',1)" aria-label="Enlarge image"><img alt="Enlarge image" src="images/camera-button-sm.jpg"" name="Image13" width="19" height="20" border="0" align="absmiddle"></a> icons). The details conveyed by the descriptions, numbers, special studies, and interpretations presented in   
						  the published archeological site report will be of interest mainly 
						  to serious students of archeology. Dig as deep as you like. </p>
                          
                            <h3>Toyah Cultural Horizon<a name="toyahculture"></a></h3>
                              <p>We don't know what the people who camped at the Hinojosa site called 
							  themselves or in what tongue they spoke. Their descendants would have been among 
							  the many  linguistically diverse native groups that came to be 
							  lumped together as <strong>Coahuiltecans</strong>, a somewhat troublesome word. Properly it is a geographical term, 
							  rather than an ethnic classification or tribal name. (See <a href="../st-plains/peoples/coahuiltecans.html" target="_blank">Who Were the &quot;Coahuiltecans&quot;?</a>) </p>
                              <p>Although their ancestry was  
                                likely local, the Indians who camped along the creek had adopted key 
                                elements of Toyah culture, a phenomenon that spread across the cultural horizon  of central 
                                and southern Texas during the latter part of the Late Prehistoric period, 
                                about 600-700 years ago during the 14th century (A.D. 1300-1400). Archeologists have also referred to the Toyah &quot;culture&quot; as a phase, interval, or horizon. </p>
                              <p>Archeologists have long thought that Toyah culture represents a rapid and 
							  widespread adaptive shift from a broadly based hunting and gathering economy to one based mainly on bison (buffalo) hunting. The impetus for this shift was said to have been  triggered by the 
							  return of herds to the region around A.D. 1300, after hundreds of years 
							  of virtual absence. Some have suggested that Toyah culture was introduced 
							  and perhaps spread by immigrant peoples who followed the bison herds into the region from the Southern Great Plains far to the northwest. The Hinojosa site tells  quite a different story. </p>
                              <p>The evidence reveals a campsite  frequented by local peoples who 
							 hunted deer and antelope much more often than bison. These big game animals were supplemented by many smaller critters and an archeologically invisible  wealth of plant foods. It does not look at all like they were 
							 newcomers to the region or visiting hunters following bison herds. All of their surviving artifacts were made from materials that came 
							 from the local area, no more than 50 miles away. They 
							 followed essentially the same way of life that generations upon generations 
							 of peoples had in the South Texas Plains. Yet, they had indeed adopted the 
							 trappings shared by dozens and perhaps hundreds of small societies over roughly 25% of the total area of Texas (67,180 square miles or 174,000 square kilometers). </p>
                              <p>In the concluding section&#8212;<a href="revisited.html" target="_blank">Hinojosa Revisited</a>&#8212;the Toyah 
							 culture idea is reassessed based on what was learned from the site. But here 
							 is the bottom line: Toyah culture is a shared set of characteristic artifacts 
							 and technologies perhaps better thought of as a "cultural horizon." 
							 It is obvious that this pattern was shared by diverse groups with different names, 
							 histories, languages, and much more. Explaining the rapid and widespread 
							 spread of the Toyah cultural horizon is an ongoing research challenge. 
							 The earlier simplistic idea that Toyah culture reflects a broad adaptive 
							 shift to and emphasis on bison hunting is just that: overly simplistic. 
							 Most groups seem to have continued to follow traditional patterns of hunting, 
							 gathering, and consuming a broad range of plants and animals, adding bison 
							 whenever they could, but that probably wasn&rsquo;t very often for most. The 
							 complex interactions among the many groups that were part of the Toyah phenomenon 
							 is the worthy subject of continued research. Now back to the campsite in deep 
							 South Texas. </p>

                              <h3>Environmental Setting <a name="environmentalsetting"></a></h3>
                              <p>The Hinojosa site overlooks Chiltipin Creek, a tributary of San Fernando 
							  Creek which empties into Baffin Bay within the famed King Ranch. In the 
							  broader perspective, the site lies near the southern tip of the Great Plains, 
							  that vast stretch of prairie grasslands that stretch for 1500 miles north to 
							  south through the central part of North America. This part of the South Texas 
							  Plains, however, is a savanna with grassy areas mixed with mesquite and 
							  scrubby thorny brush. The grassy prairies of the flat Gulf Coastal Plain 
							  lie less than 15 miles east of the Hinojosa site. </p>
							  <p>Today the site is surrounded by cultivated agricultural 
							  fields, remnant strips of narrow wooded bottomland, and brush-covered pasture. The 
							  historic impacts of livestock grazing, farming, irrigation, fencing, paving, housing, 
							  and many other modern developments have transformed the area so much that it 
							  wouldn&rsquo;t be recognizable to the native peoples who once lived here. 
							  Reconstructing the ancient setting of an archeological site is an integral 
							  part of modern archeological research. Scientists with specialties in animal 
							  bones (zooarcheology) and paleobotany were among those who helped analyze 
							  and interpret the evidence from the Hinojosa site. </p>
							  <p>When the Hinojosa site was an active campsite some 650 years ago, the 
							  climate was somewhat more favorable (wetter), the vegetation more varied 
							  with more grass and less brush and trees, and there were more wild animals 
							  including some  which are no longer native to the region (such as antelope, 
							  bison, and certain small mammals that are today present only in the wetter 
							  Eastern Woodlands). The site was occupied near the onset of the Little Ice Age, a worldwide climatic shift to cooler and wetter conditions. Although the impact of changes in global climatic patterns is never uniform, most of the region probably did experience wetter than average conditions for several centuries. </p>
                              <p> Chiltipin Creek was a small, shallow, spring-fed, mud-bottomed stream 
							  that flowed constantly. This reconstruction is based on solid  
							  evidence including the presence of several species of freshwater clams 
							  (mussels) and numerous aquatic animals including water snakes, turtles, fish, 
							  and muskrat. Today the creek flows only during floods and extended rainy 
							  periods. The Amargosa Springs upstream from the site ceased to reliably 
							  flow in the early 20th century as a result of overgrazing, vegetation 
							  transformation (less grass, more brush and trees), and ever growing demands 
							  on water resources.</p>
                              <p>The  drawing on the right shows the inferred environmental setting of the 
							  Hinojosa site, about 1350 A.D. Three major habitats surrounded the site: 
							  (1) a tall grass savanna on the deeper soils within the stream valley 
							  (today&rsquo;s prime agricultural land); (2) a narrow band of riparian 
							  (streamside) woodland along the creek; and (3) an upland area dominated 
							  by short grass and thorn brush on relatively thin soils. The local 
							  topographic relief is quite subtle and varies no more than 
							  about 60 feet within a half-mile radius of the site. Even so, the distinct 
							  habitats supported different mixes of animals and plants, variation that 
							  can be clearly seen in the animal bones. </p>
                              <p>To learn more about the site setting,  study the accompanying 
							  photographs and drawings and read Chapter 4 of the site report,
