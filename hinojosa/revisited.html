					  <p> This section is an 
					  updated interpretive 2006 summary with links to the original conclusions of the published site report. In most ways, I see the Hinojosa site 
					  today pretty much as I did in 1986, but archeological research elsewhere over the 
					  last two decades allows me to refine some inferences. And here I  try to paint a broader picture of life 600 years  ago  for a wider 
					  audience. It is to be expected that other archeologists today and in the future  may take issue with some of my  
					   interpretations.  That is the way science works.</p>
					  <p>I see the Hinjosa as a base camp or <strong>rancheria</strong> (temporary village)  
					  reoccupied by members of a single group of native people over no more than 
					  several generations, perhaps less. Despite  unresolved radiocarbon dating 
					  inconsistencies, the bulk of the assays suggest the main (and perhaps the only) 
					  occupation   period was during the latter half of the 14th century (A.D. 1350-1400), 
					  coinciding with  the initial spread of the Toyah cultural horizon into the region. The people who lived at the site  adopted  certain new ideas and technologies shared by  many other groups near and far. But they were not newcomers to the South Texas Plains. 
					  They were denizens  who continued to practice  traditional 
					  elements of the hunting and gathering way of life that characterized much of the region's prehistoric era. </p>
	                  <p>During the 14th century the location of Hinojosa site was well suited as a major 
					  campsite for peoples using stone-age technologies and living directly off the land. 
					  The prevailing climate appears to have been somewhat wetter and perhaps a bit cooler 
					  than today, conditions that allowed certain plants and animals to grow in the 
					  immediate site area that are today no longer common or even present. For instance, one of the 
					  climatic-indicator species whose bones were found  is the pine vole, a 
					  small mouse-like rodent that is today found only in the humid Eastern Woodlands, no 
					  closer than northeastern Texas. </p>
	                  <p>The inferred climatic shift for the South Texas Plains coincides with the early part of a worldwide climatic pattern often called the <strong>Little Ice Age</strong>. During the 14th through 18th centuries, the Northern Hemisphere experienced generally cooler and wetter conditions. Although the  climatic impacts were not uniform, the archeological record from the Hinojosa does provide  corroborating evidence that the South Texas Plains did indeed experience wetter and somewhat cooler conditions.</p>
	                  <p>In those wetter times,  Chiltipin Creek flowed year-round and provided 
					  easy access to mussels, fish, water snakes, turtles, and animals such as the muskrat that are no longer found in the immediate area today. The site was surrounded by 
					  more diverse habitats than those present today. Savanna grasslands instead of thorn-scrub brushlands covered most of the area, and there were different grassland habitats 
					  (econiches) dominated by tall grasses (deeper soils), short grasses (thinner upland 
					  soils), and wet/cool-adapted grasses (low-lying areas). The creek and its even 
					  smaller tributary drainages were lined by  riparian woodlands, as some 
					  stretches still are today, but with more mature trees, a better 
					  developed understory (the lower layers beneath the forest canopy), and a greater diversity of plants and animals. </p>
	                  <p>Keep in mind that many  of the differences between conditions 650 years ago and 
					  those of today were not caused by climatic variation. They are the result of historic 
					  land use practices, such as overgrazing, fire-suppression, field-leveling, plowing, 
					  cultivation of non-native species, and ever-heavier demands on surface and 
					  underground water supplies. Even though the overall climatic conditions were more 
					  favorable 650 years ago, they were well within the modern range of year-to-year variability. Over 
					  95% of the animal and plant species identified at Hinojosa are still characteristic 
					  of the region today.</p>
	                  <p>Clearly,  the Hinojosa site was  a <strong>major base camp </strong>used for 
					  more than just fleeting stays or short-term hunting camps. The accumulation of 
					  living debris is impressive, especially because the main occupation period is thought to have covered   
					  a relatively brief period of time. Although the excavated sample represents only a 
					  fraction of all of the evidence that was present, it allows us to project telling 
					  statistics. It is estimated that the site contained a minimum of over 1,700 Perdiz 
					  arrow points (mainly fragments thereof), 700 hide scrapers, and 8,000 pottery sherds. These materials are 
					  concentrated in an intensive occupation zone of 1000 square meters (about 1200 square 
					  yards) or an area measuring roughly 20-x-50 meters or roughly one-quarter the playing 
					  area of an American football field. </p>
	                  <p>We can be sure that the camp was <strong>home to entire families</strong> because of the diversity 
					  and abundance of artifacts, the evidence of intensive food preparation, and the diversity 
					  of animals,  from large to very small. Worldwide, hunting and gathering is a family-based way of life with  pronounced and predictable sexual division of labor. Although we can be certain 
					  that men were the hunters of big game, as they are in virtually every  society known 
					  the world over, we can be equally confident that women and children did most of the work 
					  and provided the bulk of the food, clothing, and other basics. Hide scraping would have been done by women and adolescent 
					  girls, as was most food preparation, camp maintenance, plant gathering, and so on. 
					  Women and children, especially adolescent boys, probably caught, snared, bopped, and 
					  otherwise collected many of the smaller animals including rabbits, rodents, fish, 
					  clams, snails and so on, most of which could have been found within a hour&rsquo;s 
					  walk. Women probably also made the pottery and many of the tools and implements save 
					  for the  weaponry.</p>
	                  <p>We have no firm basis for calculating how many people lived at the Hinojosa site 
					  or how long they stayed during any particular encampment, or even how many times the 
					  site was occupied. The 
					  sheer mass of materials tells us  that the camp was used repeatedly, an inference supported by evidence   that the site was occupied during 
					  several different times of the year. </p>
	                  <p>One of the research problems that the 1981 
	                    investigations sought to evaluate was the hypothesis that the Hinojosa site mainly 
	                    represented a winter bison hunting camp. This idea was put to rest by the finding 
	                    that deer were by far the main big game prey and by many indications that the site 
	                    was occupied in the warm months of the year. For instance, freshwater drum were most 
	                    likely caught in the early spring, while goosefoot, sunflower, hackberry seeds, 
	                    and persimmon fruits ripen in the summer. </p>
	                  <p>Hunting and gathering peoples have mobile lifestyles because there are not
					  enough available resources near any one place to stay for too long. There are also  attractive 
					  resources that are abundant only in certain places in certain times of the year. 
					  For instance, the major rivers to the east, such as the Nueces and the Guadalupe, 
					  supported large stands of native pecans that ripened in the late fall. And keep in mind that 
					  the South Texas Plains is situated on the continental climatic divide between humid 
					  and arid, east and west. The region has always experienced 
					  wetter and drier spells of varying lengths of time. The 
					  Hinojosa site could never have been a permanent village. It was 
					  one of many major camps where  the peoples who  called the place their own would have stayed 
					   as they moved across the landscape from season to season and year to year. </p>
	                  <p>One of the challenges in envisioning and understanding what the Hinojosa site was 
					  like in its heyday is the fact that we did not recognize any definite evidence of<strong> houses </strong>(huts or dwellings or structures). From the accounts of early Spanish travelers, it is almost certain that structures were erected  
					  during any stay beyond a brief visit. But in warm and relatively dry 
					  regions, hunter-gatherer dwellings wouldn&rsquo;t have been much more than a simple 
					  hut, ramada (shade arbor), or windbreak. Such &ldquo;residential structures&rdquo; 
					  would have had simple bent-pole frameworks covered by leafy branches, bundles of grass, 
					  woven mats, and/or animal hides. The most useful lightweight parts&#8212;woven mats and tanned hides&#8212;were probably taken to the next camp 
					  when the group moved on, leaving behind the frameworks and plant remains as silent 
					  organic skeletons that were soon reclaimed by vegetation and decay. </p>
	                  <p>There is one good candidate for the location of a dwelling at Hinojosa: the small 
					  pit hearth, Feature 5, which was surrounded by a small area relatively free 
					  of most debris. The accompanying <a href="images/Fig28-indexoverlay.html" target="_blank">interpretive graphic</a> <a href="images/Fig28-indexoverlay.html" target="_blank" onMouseOver="MM_swapImage('Image10','','images/camera-button-ro-sm.jpg',1)" onMouseOut="MM_swapImgRestore()" aria-label="Enlarge image"><img alt="Enlarge image" src="images/camera-button-sm.jpg"" name="Image10" width="19" height="20" border="0" align="absmiddle"></a> fuses several plan 
					  maps and shows some of the evidence. One inferred dwelling does not a rancheria make, 
					  but the site area is large enough to accommodate quite a few scattered huts 
					  strung mainly along the creek bank as several Spanish accounts describe elsewhere in the region. We&rsquo;ll 
					  never know, but larger excavations may well have provided other candidates. </p>
	                  <p>To learn more about the 1986 <a href="images/Black-1986-SiteInterp.pdf" target="_blank">site interpretations</a><a href="images/Black-1986-SiteInterp.pdf" target="_blank"> <img src="images/pdf-button.jpg" alt="Site Interpretations pdf" width="19" height="20" border="0" align="absmiddle"></a>, read Chapter 10 of the report. Chapter 11 synthesizes what was then known about the <a href="images/Black-1986-LatePre.pdf" target="_blank">Late Prehistoric era in 
					  southern Texas<img src="images/pdf-button.jpg" alt="Late Prehistoric pdf" width="19" height="20" border="0" align="absmiddle"></a> and may be most useful today as an historical review of 
					  various now-outdated interpretive concepts. The brief concluding chapter summarized the site as a 
					  <a href="images/Black-1986-ToyahCamp.pdf" target="_blank">Toyah Campsite</a> <a href="images/Black-1986-ToyahCamp.pdf" target="_blank"><img src="images/pdf-button.jpg" alt="Toyah Campsite pdf" width="19" height="20" border="0" align="absmiddle"></a>.</p>
	                  <p>In 1986 I proposed the <strong>Toyah &ldquo;horizon&rdquo;</strong> concept to emphasize that the Toyah 
					  cultural pattern seems to have spread rapidly over a broad geographic area. Archeologists of  an academic bent often 
					  argue about terminology and definitions, and that  is sometimes a healthy and necessary 
					  thing. To advance ideas, we coin new terms and redefine existing ones for new  
					  purposes. When the labels we propose stick, they are often quite useful for 
					  communication, but other new terms just add jargon and make it harder for the 
					  non-specialists and succeeding generations to follow the literature. The Toyah 
					  phenomenon is a case in point. </p>
	                  <p>The &ldquo;Toyah&rdquo; part isn&rsquo;t the problem and, in fact, helps us get 
					  around the semantic spats because at least that part doesn&rsquo;t change. But 
					  in the archeological literature you&rsquo;ll find mention of the Toyah &ldquo;phase,&rdquo; &ldquo;horizon,&rdquo; 
					  &ldquo;culture,&rdquo; &quot;techno complex,&quot; and, most recently, &ldquo;interval.&rdquo; Each of us who 
					  have championed one term over another have our reasons and we often justify our favored 
					  choice with citations, quotes, and finely split hairs. You can read my take and some of the 
					  history of  debate in the Hinojosa report. But I&rsquo;ll confess that the 
					  &ldquo;horizon&rdquo; concept, as sensible as I thought it was in 1986, 
					  hasn&rsquo;t really caught on. </p>
	                  <p>Toyah  is a broad cultural pattern exemplified by a distinctive set of 
					  artifacts sometimes known as the &ldquo;<strong>Toyah tool kit</strong>.&rdquo; This set of things 
					  reflects the adoption of a set of technologies (bow and arrow weaponry, large animal 
					  butchering and skinning tools, earthenware pottery making). Based on the ethnic diversity encountered by the Spanish in the 16th and 17th centuries, the Toyah cultural pattern was obviously shared by many different groups speaking different languages, having different names, living in different territories, and, in general, having different lives, different histories, different ethnicities and so on.  </p>
	                  <p>But what does this widespread pattern say about how these diverse groups interacted? What accounts for the shared material culture? What did trigger the widespread dissemination  of the Toyah tool kit? Climatic change? Population pressure? Buffalo migration? How do the  small-scale societies that shared Toyah culture in late prehistoric times relate to the historic Indian groups observed by the Spanish in the 16th and 17th centuries? What happened to Toyah culture? </p>
	                  <p>The evidence from the Hinojosa campsite on the Toyah horizon in deep south Texas may continue to prove useful in helping archeologists come up with more convincing answers to these questions. <strong>And ask better ones.</strong> </p></td>

					circle marks the possible location of a dwelling (hut). Lacking any direct trace of 
					postholes or other definitive structural evidence, we cannot be sure. Nonetheless, 
					based on the accounts of early Spanish travelers, it is almost certain that structures 
					would have been  erected and present at the Hinojosa camp during any stay beyond a 
					brief visit.<br>

					 <div class="caption">Radiocarbon dates from sites in South Texas showing the two 
					 major inferred periods or “horizons” of the Late Prehistoric era.  The graphic 
					 suggests that intervals are better thought of as successive cultural patterns that 
					 probably coexisted for about a century.  The dates on the left are associated with 
					 the earlier pattern labeled as the Austin Horizon (ca. 1100-1400 A.D.), during which 
					 the bow and arrow and pottery first appear in the region.  The dates on the right are 
					 associated with the later pattern which Black termed the Toyah Horizon (ca. 1300-1600 
					 A.D.) as exemplified by the Hinojosa site. Notice that within each group are clear 
					 outliers that represent dating problems rather than occupational reality. Click to see the larger
