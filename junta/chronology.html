<p align="left">The confluence of two major rivers in the northern Chihuahuan Desert must have attracted humans from earliest times onward. The ever-flowing water and the concentration and  diversity of plants and animals in a protected setting would have always attracted desert-dwelling native peoples, especially during droughts and winters. &nbsp; But in the immediate vicinity  of La Junta, archeologists have yet to find definitive  evidence  of human occupations prior to the Late Archaic period roughly 3,000 years ago.</p>
<p align="left">Our lack of   archeological evidence  at La Junta for the first 10,000 years or so of  Trans-Pecos prehistory is easy enough to understand&mdash;rivers giveth and taketh away  through time.&nbsp; Over the millennia the Rios Conchos and Grande experienced hundreds of major  floods.&nbsp; Unmistakable  evidence of flood deposits and erosion  is  readily visible: the massive floodplains along the rivers today and the higher  river terraces often  situated far away from, and well above, historic high water marks.&nbsp; </p>
<p align="left">Generally speaking, during wet climatic periods  and during moderate scale floods, the rivers would have  tended to add more sediment than they stripped away. Conversely,  erosion usually prevails during dry  periods punctuated by  massive flood events.&nbsp; Over time the give and take processes of deposition and erosion would have sometimes washed away traces of campsites and sometimes covered them up with thick layers of mud, sand, and gravel. While we  predict that  convincing evidence of early human occupations does indeed exist in the La Junta district, it must be  deeply  buried within the terrace deposits lining  the rivers. Deeply buried evidence is hard to search for and even harder  to explore through large-scale excavation. </p>
<p align="left">The chart on the right shows the known <strong>cultural chronology</strong> of the La Junta region as used by archeologists today for the last three thousand years. The major periods  shown in gray are fairly standard terms used by most archeologists in Texas. The brightly colored blocks represent cultural patterns that have been defined for the eastern Trans Pecos region (on the left) and for the La Junta district (&quot;Bravo Valley Phases&quot; on the right). </p>


<p align="left">Most of the cultural patterns were first recognized and named by earlier archeologists, especially J. Charles Kelley and his colleagues in the 1930s and 1940s. Kelley's ideas have been refined and the patterns better dated in recent decades, but we still have a long way to go. As explained in the<a href="investigations.html"> Investigations </a>section, La Junta and the eastern  Trans-Pecos in general has seen far less modern research than most other  areas.&nbsp; New evidence  from ongoing research will greatly improve our understanding of how the  early human history of La Junta unfolded. And the chronological and descriptive scheme we outline here will be further refined as ideas are reevaluated and new aspects of human history emerge.  </p>
<p align="left">The periods and phases shown on the chart are summarized  in chronological order, earliest to latest. Our concepts and understandings of prehistory  and early history do not always neatly fit within the tidy blocks of time we archeologists lay out. We are, after all, trying to impose a convenient organizational framework over long spans of time during which cultural traditions often persisted for many, many generations. </p>
<h3 align="center">Late Archaic <br>
  3,000 to  1,300 years ago (1000 B.C. &ndash; A.D. 700)</h3>
<p align="left">Kelley&rsquo;s work in the Big Bend  and  the La Junta district in the 1930s and 1940s (see<a href="investigations.html"> Investigations</a>) led to the development of a scheme to subdivide the regional  cultural manifestations from the Archaic to the present using the terms <em>aspect</em> and <em>focus</em>. Kelley referred to what archeologists today call the  Archaic period or era (see <a href="../faq/index.html#13">FAQ</a>) as the &ldquo;Big   Bend Cave aspect,&rdquo; consisting  of an earlier &ldquo;Pecos   River focus&rdquo; and a later  &ldquo;Chisos focus.&rdquo; Today the latter is called the Late Archaic by most researchers  working in the Big Bend. This term refers to the  final portion of the long-lived Archaic era, a 9,000-year span of human time during which  relatively small  groups of hunter-gatherers in the eastern Trans-Pecos Mountains and Basins successfully adapted to the desert environment. Their conservative cultural traditions changed slowly, at least those that we can see in the archeological record. Archaic hunters used the atlatl and dart (spear-thrower and spear) as their primary  weapon, but  most of the food would have come from plant gathering and from  the use of  techniques such as trapping, poisoning, and netting to harvest smaller animals and  fish.</p>
<p align="left">Recent investigations of Late Archaic evidence in the eastern  Trans-Pecos point toward this as a period of population increase.&nbsp; The evidence for this inference includes the  widespread use of virtually the entire landscape (sites are everywhere), the  appearance of many different projectile point forms (dart point  styles or &quot;types&quot;), and intensification of specialized plant food processing economies  (such as plant baking). Toward the end of this period, nomadic hunter-gatherer  bands may have begun to experiment with early forms of agriculture, but so far the  evidence for this is not  clear. </p>
<p align="left">Robert J. Mallouf has hypothesized that the sudden appearance in the  eastern Trans Pecos of dart point styles that are characteristic of central  Texas (including the Edwards Plateau) during the first  half of the Late Archaic may be related to wetter conditions that allowed bison  herds to migrate into the region from the Southern Plains. Thus far, however, bison remains dating to the Late Archaic have yet to be  found in the  eastern Trans-Pecos. &nbsp;Regardless, the central  Texas-style dart points occur in large enough numbers to suggest that new groups moved into the region from the east around 3,000 years  ago.&nbsp; The alternative explanation,  &quot;cultural diffusion,&quot; or the spread of  dart-point-making ideas from the east rather than people, is considered less likely.</p>
<p align="left">Mallouf and other researchers have documented a  marked increase in the number of Late Archaic sites in comparison  to those dating to earlier time periods. This pattern  combined with a greater diversity of artifact forms, is interpreted as the  result of population increase and greater cultural interactions  with the outside world. Late Archaic  sites are found in practically every ecological  niche in the region, from the lowest basins to the highest mountain peaks. The  sites from this period are accompanied by a wide variety of dart point types, including Shumla, Paisano, Palmillas, Ensor, Frio,  Marcos, Conejo, Charcos, Figueroa, Ellis, Lange, Montell, and San Pedro. There are  also numerous relatively small, untyped dart points from the region that probably   date to Late Archaic times.</p>
<p align="left">Yet at La Junta, sites attributable to the Late Archaic are  relatively uncommon. Late Archaic dart points have been observed at several  sites along the river&mdash;an eroded site near Presidio, Texas, and a disturbed site  just upstream from Colorado Canyon&mdash;and a thin, buried cultural lens at the  Arroyo de la Presa site  downstream from Presidio has yielded a  radiocarbon  assay of 1060&ndash;880 B.C. from the earliest portion of the  period.  The most likely  explanation that so few Late Archaic sites are known from the immediate area is  that evidence of such sites lies buried within the alluvial terraces along the  rivers. &nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">It should be pointed out that dart points dating to the Late and Middle Archaic periods are known to occur in campsites found in the mountain pediments overlooking the Rio Grande valley in the vicinity of La Junta. Beyond the river valley Archaic sites are relatively common. So there is no question that people were in the area. </p>
<p align="left">Toward the end of the Late Archaic in the western Trans-Pecos, Jornada Mogollon culture spread  into far western Texas (El   Paso area and somewhat farther east) from south-central New Mexico. (See <a href="../firecracker/mogollon.html">Jornada Mogollon</a>). Early Jornada  Mogollon people were villagers who relied on traditional hunting and gathering as  well as agriculture&mdash;raising their own crops.&nbsp;  They lived in pithouse villages and they made ceramic cooking and storage  containers.&nbsp; The  combination of more settled life, agriculture, and ceramic technology  represented a new way of life, and Jornada Mogollon archeologists refer to this  time as the &ldquo;formative&rdquo; period. Parallel developments also took place in the Casas Grandes region in northern Chihuahua and elsewhere in northern Mexico beginning by 1500-1000 B.C. </p>
<p align="left">Thus far, however, there is little solid evidence that these innovations seriously altered the  nomadic hunter-gatherer lifeways in the  eastern Trans-Pecos or directly influenced the development of agriculture there.&nbsp; We suspect that evidence of incipient agriculture dating to the first centuries A.D.  will be found  in certain of the places in the  eastern Trans-Pecos  highly favorable to growing crops, such as the  floodplains of  La Junta. At this same time or shortly thereafter, diminutive dart point forms are found throughout the region. As Mallouf has put it, these points, including the Figueroa type, &ldquo;seem to represent the transition from use  of the atlatl to the bow and arrow.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 align="center">Late Prehistoric<br> 
  1300 to 500 years ago  (A.D. 700-1535)</h3> 

<p align="left">Texas archeologists use the term "Late Prehistoric"  to refer to the last 800-900 years of prehistoric life (that is, before written accounts begin to document Trans-Pecos history).   Much more is known about this interval of time than earlier ones in the Trans-Pecos region, as is the case  virtually the world over. This information allows archeologists to understand narrower periods of time and more subtle differences in cultural patterns.  The earliest  historic documents from Cabeza de Vaca's arrival at La Junta in 1535 provide eyewitness accounts of native peoples still living &quot;prehistoric&quot; lifestyles. As a result of these richer sources of data, archeologists have defined various phases, complexes, and other categorizations  breaking down the Late Prehistoric era into more meaningful patterns.
<p align="left">The Late Prehistoric was a time of change and cultural transformation throughout the eastern Trans-Pecos, as it was across most areas of North America.  In adjacent regions, such as the American Southwest, the Southern Plains, and northwestern Mexico, populations increased, weaponry changed from the atlatl and dart to the bow and arrow, ceramic technology was adopted, trade flourished, and life for many peoples became less nomadic and more settled as more and more people lived in fixed villages.  Some changes were triggered by climatic shifts, but the likely "prime mover" was population increase, a continental (if not worldwide) pattern.  With more and more people on the landscape came increased conflict, as more powerful and aggressive groups moved into areas where others already lived.  
<p align="left"> Farming,  village life,  bow and arrow weaponry, and the &quot;container revolution&quot; (pottery making)  seem to have spread into the eastern Trans-Pecos mostly  from the American Southwest, while similar changes were taking place in the Southern Plains. The most likely &quot;donor&quot; or source area for these changes is probably  the Jornada Mogollon culture, some 150-200 miles up the Rio Grande. The Casas Grandes culture some 200-250 miles to the west-northwest in western Chihuahua also influenced some groups in the eastern Trans-Pecos, such as those who lived at La Junta. 
<p align="left">But most of the region remained the domain of highly mobile hunting and gathering peoples throughout prehistoric times. Across  most of the eastern Trans-Pecos, the bow and arrow was the only technological advancement that was universally embraced. Prevailing arid conditions in combination with the conservative nomadic lifeways of most groups in the region did not favor the adoption of agriculture, village life, and ceramic technology beyond a cursory level. Within the La Junta district sedentary or at least semi-sedentary villages formed by at least A.D. 1200 and all of the technological innovations mentioned above were accepted. Agriculture, ceramics, and village life all went hand-in-hand, as agriculture was needed to produce enough food to allow people to stay in villages, and ceramics were necessary for cooking, water transportation, and  crop surplus storage for the winter months. 
    <p align="left">Arrow point styles documented in the larger region during the Late Prehistoric era  include the Livermore, Scallorn, Desert Side-notched, Toyah, Perdiz, Cliffton, Garza/Soto, and Fresno types. Practically all of these styles have been found in both the La Junta agricultural villages as well as hunter-gatherer sites within the region. This overlap points to the fact that we have yet to unravel the  undoubtedly complex  interactions and interrelationships between villagers and nomads during the Late Prehistoric.
    <p align="left">Two distinctive Late Prehistoric 
    hunter-gatherer cultural patterns 
    in the eastern Trans-Pecos Mountains and Basins are relevant to La Junta: the Livermore phase and the Cielo complex. 
    <p align="left"><strong><em>Livermore Phase (ca. A.D. 800&ndash;1200)</em> </strong><br>
&nbsp; <br>
For the earliest portion of the Late Prehistoric period, when hunting  and gathering lifeways still persisted throughout the entire region, a  distinctive style of arrow point, the Livermore  point, is characteristic of the area.&nbsp;  The  Livermore  phase is thought to have begun about A.D. 800 and ended around A.D. 1200.  Characterized by the consistent presence of three arrow point types, Livermore, Toyah, and Fresno, and a hunting-gathering  tool kit, including beveled knives, this phase is concentrated in the Davis Mountains  and Lobo Valley within the central and western  portions of the region.  Mallouf, however, believes the phase essentially  encompasses the entire eastern Trans-Pecos and is largely confined to that region. He defines  a western boundary along the Sierra Vieja, Van  Horn, and Sierra Diablo mountain ranges, a northern boundary in southeastern New Mexico, an eastern boundary east of the Pecos River,  and a southern boundary in northern Coahuila and northeastern Chihuahua.
    <p align="left">In the La Junta district, Livermore  points have been recovered from the Arroyo de la Presa site   downstream from Presidio, and at other sites along the river, but do not occur  in the La Junta villages. In 1940 Kelley  hypothesized that the Livermore  phase represented an influx of new peoples in the region, and later suggested  this group may have originally been Plains Indians. Mallouf, however, argues that the group could have been indigenous to the Trans-Pecos region,  noting that neither hypothesis has been seriously investigated. Kelley has also suggested the Livermore phase may have played a role in  development of the La Junta phase. Much research remains to be done for a  sound understanding of this enigmatic hunting and gathering group.</p>
    <p align="left"><em><strong>Cielo Complex (A.D. 1300-1680)</strong></em>
    <p align="left"> First recognized by Robert Mallouf in the late 1970s, the Cielo complex is a Late Prehistoric pattern found across most of the Texas Big Bend and    southward into northeastern Chihuahua  and northwestern Coahuila. It  was created by hunters and gatherers who occupied small sites found almost exclusively on high places in the landscape. Some appear to be base-camp villages that were probably seasonally reoccupied, while others look like short-term encampments. Various other site types are known as well such as isolated cairn burials and areas where specialized resources, such as plants, were harvested. </p>
    <p align="left">Their houses were not elaborate semi-permanent pithouses like those of the La Junta villagers. Instead they were  wickiups that left distinctive  archeological signatures:  circular stacked-stone foundations  with doorway gaps. Wickiups are brush-framed huts roofed with  grass thatch or hides that could be built quickly. </p>
    <p align="left"> Oddly, although  several major Cielo sites occur along the Rio Grande on mountain pediments overlooking the La Junta district, Cielo peoples did not use pottery. Yet radiocarbon dates show that Cielo sites located on the edge of the district, such as Arroyo de las Burras near Redford, were occupied during the La Junta phase. Cielo peoples must have interacted with La Junta peoples, but they seem to have remained apart, living a different lifestyle. While we might suppose  that the two groups were ethnically distinct and spoke different languages,  their relationships remain unclear. Robert Mallouf has suggested that the two groups may  in fact have been closely related. </p>
    <p align="left">Their material culture includes an array of stone tools: Perdiz  arrow points, flake drills, hide scrapers, occasional  beveled  knives, a host of expediency  tools fashioned on both flakes and blades, occasional oval pestles, and a variety  of manos. End-notched sinker stones (&quot;net sinkers&quot;) occur at several of the Cielo sites overlooking the Rio Grande.  Other Cielo artifacts were  bone rasps, fragments of  deer-ulna awls, small bone and stone beads, tiny turquoise beads, and <em>Olivella</em> shell beads. Many Cielo artifacts are quite similar to those found at La Junta sites. </p>
    <p align="left">Mallouf  has theorized that both the La Junta phase and the  Cielo complex are ancestral manifestations of the sixteenth century group  identified in Spanish documents as &ldquo;Jumano Indians.&rdquo; He further suggests that  these related groups had shared identities dating back as far as A.D. 1300 and  that both have non-Athapaskan ethnic origins among hunter-gatherers indigenous  to the Southern Plains or northeastern Chihuahuan Desert  region. </p>
    <p align="left">Mallouf's model suggests that the La Junta phase and Cielo complex peoples  were interacting somewhat like genetically-linked &quot;cousins,&rdquo; with the La Junta  folks practicing a semisedentary, agricultural-based  lifestyle (supplemented by hunting  and gathering) and Cielo complex groups  a pure hunting and  gathering lifeway. The two groups interacted through seasonal trading where  food items and other as yet unknown goods were exchanged. They must have had at least partially overlapping territories and clearly regarded one another as allies. They may well have been interrelated through marriage and other social mechanisms. After collapse of the Casas Grandes interaction  sphere (see <a href="villagers.html">First Villagers</a>), Mallouf thinks that the La Junta phase peoples may have joined  their cousins in the hunting and gathering lifeway, archaeologically manifested  as the Cielo complex.</p>
    <h3 align="center"> Bravo Valley Cultures</h3>
    <p align="left">In 1940 Kelley, Campbell, and Lehmer described what they saw as a cultural  continuum in the La Junta district during the Late Prehistoric, Protohistoric,  and Historic periods for which they applied the term<strong> Bravo Valley  Aspect</strong>. They subdivided this &ldquo;aspect&rdquo; or evolving cultural pattern into the La  Junta, Concepcion, and Conchos  &ldquo;foci&rdquo; using what is known as the Midwestern taxonomic scheme, or McKern system  after its proponent archeologist W. C. McKern. &nbsp;This classification approach is no longer in  use in North American archeology, as explained in more detail elsewhere in this  website (see <a href="../villagers/research/antelope.html">Antelope Creek Defined</a>). &nbsp;While archeologists have abandoned the terms aspect and  focus (plural = foci), the Bravo   Valley concept is still  useful, particularly its subdivisions, which we now call &ldquo;phases.&rdquo; (The term Bravo Valley is synonymous with the La Junta district.) </p>
    <p align="left">The <strong>La Junta phase</strong> falls within the latter part of the Late Prehistoric  period, while the <strong>Concepcion phase</strong> spans the final decades of the Late Prehistoric and the Protohistoric period. The term &ldquo;protohistoric&rdquo; refers to  that interval of roughly 150 years between the initial European encounters with the  native peoples of La Junta (see <a href="encounters.html">Early Encounters</a>) and the period when the  Spanish began colonizing the region in the late 17th century.&nbsp; The <strong>Conchos phase</strong>  is associated with the &quot;Mission&quot; period, the 80-year span which saw the &quot;Spanish acculturation of the Indian villages,&rdquo;  as Kelley and his colleagues put it.</p>
    <p align="left">Key elements of the Bravo Valley  cultural pattern are pithouse villages, the practice of agriculture, and the  use of pottery, some of it locally made and some of it imported.  While the arrival of the Spanish triggered  many changes to La Junta life, the degree of underlying cultural continuity is rather remarkable. For instance, in the late 1930s, some La Junta area residents  still lived in houses that were made from essentially the same materials using the same construction techniques first used at La Junta some 700 years earlier. </p>
    
    <p align="left">&nbsp;The key Bravo Valley  sites are reviewed in the <a href="sites.html">La Junta Sites </a>section while the human history of the La Junta district  is told in more detail in the <a href="villagers.html">First Villagers</a>, <a href="encounters.html">Early Encounters</a>, <a href="frontier.html">Spanish  Frontier</a>, and <a href="border.html">Mexican Border</a> sections. Here the aim is to outline the Bravo Valley framework and summarize the archeological manifestations of the historic era. </p>
    <p align="left"><span class="style3"><em>La Junta Phase</em> <em>(ca.  A.D. 1200&ndash;1450)</em></span></p>
    <p align="left">This phase sees the establishment of sedentary or semi-sedentary pithouse  villages in the La Junta district by native peoples who practiced agriculture  and used pottery.&nbsp; Settled village life  and   farming represented a fundamental economic and social  transformation from the age-old tradition of mobile hunting and gathering.&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="left">La Junta phase villages, some consisting of dozens of houses, were situated on terraces and pediments along  the Rio Grande  and lower R&iacute;o Conchos. They are all located in sections of the river valleys  that had relatively broad floodplains suitable for farming. The overall settlement pattern is not well known, but based on early historic accounts and available archeological data there were likely larger &quot;main&quot; villages, smaller villages  we might call &quot;hamlets,&quot; and scattered field houses located on the floodplains where crops were grown. While  crops such as corn, beans, and squash were an important and distinctive element of the diet, the villagers also relied on hunting, fishing, and gathering  wild plant foodstuffs.</p>
    <p align="left">Only the village sites have seen archeological excavation and the houses there were relatively substantial constructions. Most houses consisted of rectangular pole and adobe structures  placed over or within relatively shallow pits (although a few pits  are up to six feet deep). The  houses had flat-topped roofs and roof entrances.  The villagers often buried their dead below house floors.</p>
    <p align="left">La Junta &nbsp;phase villagers seemed to have used only imported pottery instead of pottery they made locally. This seems curious as later villagers made their own pottery and developed distinctive styles. The non-local pottery is predominately of a style known as El Paso Polychrome, which was made by the Jornada Mogollon. Other Southwestern pottery types, especially  types made by Casas Grandes peoples, also occur.</p>
    <p align="left">The La Junta phase is estimated to have lasted for about 250 years. Around A.D. 1450, settled life in the district seems to have come to a temporary halt. Kelley speculated that prolonged drought made farming unreliable. The evidence of a hiatus, or period of abandonment, is not clear, nor is the timing and possible link to climatic change. What is clear is that by early protohistoric times in the 16th century  there were marked changes in architecture and pottery that signal some sort of cultural shift. See <a href="villagers.html">First Villagers </a>for more of the La Junta phase story. </p>
    <p align="left"><strong><em>Concepcion Phase (ca.  A.D. 1500?&ndash;1684)</em> </strong></p>
    <p align="left">  Kelley originally thought the Concepcion phase began  somewhat seamlessly following the end of the La Junta phase. In other words he thought the changes happened gradually. Later he outlined a different scenario&#8212;the hiatus idea&#8212;and suggested that a period of abandonment lasting  as long as 100 years may have occurred. He wrote that the Concepcion phase may have started as late as A.D. 1550, although this seems most unlikely given what Cabeza de Vaca and his companions witnessed in 1535 (See <a href="encounters.html">Early Encounters</a>). </p>
    <p align="left">During the Concepcion phase, houses were both  rectangular and circular to oval and still being constructed in pits; however,  they were much larger than during the preceding La Junta phase. These houses also differed from those of the preceding phase by  their apparent lack of adobe. The <em>jacal</em> superstructures (walls and roofs) were made of&quot; wattle and daub&quot;&#8212;mud-plastered woven-pole frameworks. Pit floors were either tramped gravel or packed refuse.   Although the rectangular pithouses were typically arranged in rows, with from  three to seven interconnected, isolated examples of these houses have also been  documented. Besides being larger, the circular to oval houses had more  supporting posts than were used during the preceding phase.</p>
    <p align="left">The Concepcion  phase is further distinguished from the earlier phase by the associated pottery, although virtually all stone, bone, and shell artifacts are quite  similar. The imported Southwestern pottery from  Casas Grandes and the El Paso area   were no longer present. Instead there is a profusion of new types of pottery that Kelley suspected were locally produced. He named the new pottery types Chinati Plainware, Capote Red-on-brown,  and Paloma Red-on-gray. Later he added three other types to the list&mdash;Chinati  Scored, Chinati Filleted Rim, and Capote Plain. A few trade wares from distant native sources occur, as indicated by the  presence of two sherds at Loma Alta of Patton Engraved, an East Texas Caddoan type. This pottery was probably brought to La Junta by Jumano Indians who are known to have traveled to the Caddo settlements in eastern Texas.</p>
    <p align="left">The Concepcion phase is when the Spanish first arrived at La Junta and returned periodically, sometimes with the intention of converting the natives to Christianity and claiming new lands for Spain. But other Spanish intrusions had deadly consequences for La Junta peoples. To provide the labor necessary to exploit silver mines in northern New Spain, some 200 miles to the south of La Junta, private mercenaries -- slave traders - -began raiding the villages and enslaving native peoples. See <a href="encounters.html">Early Encounters</a> for the story that emerges from historical accounts. </p>
    <p align="left"><strong><em>Conchos Phase (ca. A.D. 1684&ndash;1760)</em> </strong></p>
    <p align="left">During  the Conchos phase or Mission period there was a steady increase  in the presence of Spaniards at La Junta causing drastic changes to the  lifeways of indigenous peoples. Many Indians perished and all survivors were either forced to move elsewhere or were &quot;acculturated,&quot; meaning they were absorbed into the Spanish Colonial world through marriage, economy, and language.  The establishment of missions at La Junta in ca. A.D. 1684 is arbitrarily used  to  mark  the end of the Concepcion phase and the  beginning of the Conchos phase. </p>
    <p align="left">During the Mission period most La Junta dwellings continued to be made in what Kelley called the Rectangular House tradition, although fewer and fewer were semi-subterranean pithouses.  Two unusual circular to oval  structures that have been excavated may indicate survival of the Circular House  tradition. These structures were found to contain appreciably  more roof support posts than were used in the preceding phases. The larger posts were arranged in rows of  three in the east and west halves of the floor; the smaller ones set close  together and occurring both around the periphery of the tramped gravel floor  and at the edge of the pit on the ground surface. Kelley suggested the small interior posts may have been used as platform or floor  supports.</p>
    <p align="left">Although  the stone tools  went virtually unchanged from the previous period, the Conchos  phase is distinguished archeologically by the  presence of artifacts of European or Mexican origin, including  majolica wares,  Spanish utility wares, and metal items. Indigenous pottery styles found associated with the  phase include Conchos Plain, Conchos Red-on-brown, and Pulicos Red-on-brown,  with some continued manufacture of types from the preceding phase&mdash;Capote  Red-on-brown, and Chinati Plain, Striated-Neck, and Neck-Banded.  The  recent recovery of several comal sherds (pottery fragments from flat tortilla griddles) from the site may indicate Indians from  Central Mexico were also at La Junta at this  time. See <a href="frontier.html">Spanish Frontier</a> for the story that emerges from historical accounts.</p>
	<p align="left"><strong>Alamito and Presidio Phases (1760-modern)</strong></p>
	<p align="left">Kelley used the Alamito focus to designate the local Mexican culture which began developing as the Spanish Colonial era ended. When Texas became part of the United States the same Mexican culture existed on both sides of the border. In many ways this remains true today. The Presidio focus was Kelley's  term for the Anglo ranching and business culture that developed mainly on the Texas side of the border after 1850. In reality, Mexican and Anglo peoples and cultures have long been co-mingled in the La Junta area. See <a href="border.html">Mexican Border</a>. </p>
	<p align="left">Kelley and his colleagues Campbell and Lehmer were struck by what they saw as many parallels between the prehistoric and Spanish Colonial Bravo Valley cultures and the later historic and modern cultures. Shared farming methods, construction techniques, and construction materials, were seen as direct continuities. The extent to which these continuities are best explained by shared cultural heritage or by shared ecological setting can be debated. </p>
	<p align="left">Today the terms Alamito and Presidio foci (or phases) are rarely used by archeologists and never by anyone else. They are perhaps best considered as quaint vestiges of Kelley's encompassing chronological scheme.</p>

        Kelley considered his Bravo Valley sequence to be merely a "working framework." In 1990 he lamented the fact that this framework "unfortunately soon achieved the status of a dogma."
