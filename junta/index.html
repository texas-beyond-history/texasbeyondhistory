	<p align="left">Along the southwestern frontier of Trans-Pecos Texas and northeastern Chihuahua, the two largest  rivers found within the vastness of the Chihuahuan Desert join one another in a confluence of that most precious desert resource&#8212;water. The Rio Grande and Rio Conchos meet at the sister cities of Presidio, Texas and Ojinaga, Chihuahua within the Presidio Bolson, a drainage basin framed by serrated mountain ranges. </p>
	<p align="left">Here beginning around 800 years ago (A.D. 1200), if not  earlier, village life was  established at the river juncture the Spanish named <em>La Junta de los Rios</em>. These settlements were partially supported by agriculture and trade, although wild animals and plants   were integral to  the La Juntan diet and way of life. The transition from  nomadic hunting and gathering lifeways to sedentary  village life appears  to have still been underway when  the Spanish arrived with  Old World crops and livestock  in the 16th and 17th centuries.  Based on the early written accounts and emerging archeological data,  La Junta was a cultural crossroads where farmers and hunters, nomads and villagers, peaceful and aggressive native groups came and went, mingled and traded, celebrated and conspired. It was like no other place in the Trans-Pecos Mountains and Basins. </p>
	<p align="left">The native villages at La Junta were first seen by Europeans in 1535 when  Cabeza de Vaca and three companions traveled through the area. Beginning about 45 years later, a number of Spanish <em>entradas</em> (expeditions) passed through La Junta, providing written accounts of the native peoples living in scattered villages along the two rivers. These expeditions set the stage for a greater Spanish presence in the area, culminating with the establishment of missions in the 1680s and <em>presidios</em> (forts) in the 1760s. Later, in the 1800s, La Junta was a stopping point on the Chihuahua Trail, a trade route that linked the port of Indianola, Texas on the Gulf of Mexico and Chihuahua City, Chihuahua in northern Mexico. In the early 1900s the  area was briefly renown  because of its ringside seat on the Mexican Revolution. Today La Junta is part of a unique border culture that is largely isolated from the outside world, a remote spot on the sparsely settled borderlands amid the Chihuahuan Desert. </p>
	<p align="left">The Spanish accounts of   La Junta have been interpreted and debated by Southwestern historians and ethnohistorians for many decades. Yet much of the story of its native peoples  remains to be fully told, particularly that of its earliest human history in prehistoric times.  The Spanish were drawn to La Junta because of what it already was&#8212;an established cultural crossroads. La Junta was, in fact, what can properly be called the <strong>southeasternmost outpost of the ancient American Southwest</strong>. Here the Spanish found settled peoples living in flat-roofed houses and growing crops, people who knew of peoples and  places hundreds of miles away.</p>
	<p align="left">But how did this cultural crossroads come to be in the first place? When did settled life begin at La Junta? Who were the first villagers? Were they Jornada Mogollon colonists or were they indigenous peoples from the local area who adopted the Southwestern lifestyle? To what extent was early village life a full-time existence based on agriculture? How were the La Juntan villagers related  to contemporary hunting and gathering groups?   Did La Junta supply resources to the  great redistribution center of Casas Grandes in northwestern Chihuahua?  Did La Junta experience a prolonged period of abandonment   before the Spanish arrived? How did La Junta  life change through time?</p>
	<p align="left">This exhibit addresses these questions and tells the story of  La Junta's native  history based on archeological evidence and  ethnohistorical interpretations of Spanish documents. We also tell the unfinished story of  archeological investigation. These stories are still unfolding&#8212;a great deal of research remains to be done. Yet we know enough to realize that La Junta deserves to be recognized as a far more significant place in the human history of the southeastern American Southwest and the Trans-Pecos Mountains and Basins than most of us know.</p>
	<p align="left">The archeological investigation of the La Junta got off to a very good start in the 1930s and 1940s with the pioneering work of <strong>J. Charles Kelley</strong>, who grew up in nearby Balmorhea. Kelley was introduced to archeology in the early 1930s as a student of Victor J. Smith, who taught industrial arts at Sul Ross State College and became the first resident archeologist of the Big Bend. Beginning in the late 1930s, Kelley literally put the La Junta '&quot;district&quot;  on the archeological map and brought it to scholarly attention. His 1947 dissertation at Harvard University combined his archeological findings with  ethnohistoric research on Spanish accounts of La Junta. But in 1950 he moved to Southern Illinois University where  for the next 26 years he was a professor of anthropology and a museum director. He soon  shifted his primary research interests southward into the northern frontier of Mesoamerica. There he spent many seasons carrying out fieldwork in north-central Mexico, particularly in the Mexican states of Durango and Zacatecas while investigating  the Chalchihuites culture. </p>
	<p align="left"> Almost 40 years would elapse before anyone would follow in his La Juntan footsteps. Thus, until recently Kelley's ideas have been almost all we've had to go on. He himself knew full well that his interpretations were tentative and often based on meager data and incomplete analyses. Kelley returned to his Trans-Pecos roots when he retired in 1976  and moved to Ft. Davis. He was   most gratified to see new research get underway in the La Junta area in the 1980s under  Robert J. Mallouf, then the State Archeologist of Texas.  Before he died in 1997, Kelley published several studies summarizing his earlier work and putting forth his latest thinking. It is no exaggeration to proclaim that most of what we now know about the native history of La Junta de los Rios can still be credited to J. Charles Kelley. </p>
	<p align="left">In the last two decades modern  research methods have been brought to bear on  the archeology of La Junta, albeit on a relatively small scale. State-of-the-art archeological research is time-consuming and quite costly. While much remains to be done and many questions are yet  unanswered, ongoing archeological field investigations, new laboratory analyses, and renewed ethnohistorical research are yielding new insights. So have the  results of concerted research in adjacent regions, especially the greater American Southwest. </p>
