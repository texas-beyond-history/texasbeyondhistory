    <td width="480" height="438" valign="top">

    <p>On a cold winter day in 1686, the <em>Belle</em>, flagship of the  French explorer La Salle, hit a sandbar in Matagorda Bay,  the victim  of bad luck and a sudden violent storm. The<em> Belle</em> was part of a four-ship expedition led  La Salle. The  explorer had hoped to establish a trading port at the mouth of the Mississippi River  (today, that would be at the city of New    Orleans). There the French could have traded with the  local Indians and sent furs and other items back to France. More importantly, the settlement would have given the French an  advantage over the Spanish, who had already claimed vast tracts of land in the New World for Spain. And there were Spanish gold mines that La Salle had heard of, as well. La Salle hoped to launch an invasion of New Spain from his Mississippi port. </p>
    <h3>La Salle Misses  the Mississippi </h3>
   <p>La Salle had grand dreams, but here's what happened. The expedition first suffered  a pirate attack near Petit Grove in the West Indies, with the pirates taking one of La Salle's ships. Poor navigation and bad leadership marred the remainder of the expedition. Sailors of the 17th century  had only crude instruments to steer by and even less reliable maps. In February,  1685, La Salle&rsquo;s remaining three ships landed on the Texas coast.&nbsp;  They had missed the mouth of the Mississippi  and were almost <strong>400 miles</strong> west of their  intended destination!</p>

<p>
Bad luck continued. La Salle's attempts to find the Mississippi River failed. Then the <em>Aimable</em>, the  largest ship carrying most of his supplies, sunk in Matagorda   Bay. The settlers traveling with La Salle  were stranded and miserable on the beach. To provide temporary shelter and protection from  the local Karankawa Indians, the small settlement of Fort  St. Louis was established on the banks  of a creek above the head of Lavaca   Bay. The expedition was  further weakened, however, when  a group of unhappy colonists, soldiers, and crew decided to leave and return  to France on  La Salle&rsquo;s naval vessel, <em>Joly</em>. Meanwhile, La Salle kept widening the search for the Mississippi River, leaving  a small group of settlers at Fort   Saint Louis and a few  crewmen on the last remaining ship, the <em>Belle</em>.</p>
<h3>Water, Water All Around </h3>
<p>
  On board <em>La Belle</em>,  supplies begin to run low. The crew was dying of thirst, and the ship's best  sailors had been killed by the Karankawa in a failed attempt to go ashore to  get water. Even though they were only about a quarter of a mile from shore, the  sailors could not travel to land without boats or rafts.&nbsp; Most 17th-century European sailors  did not know how to swim, even though they traveled over the deepest oceans! So  they stayed on board, waited, and suffered. There was water all around them, but none they could drink! </p>
<p>On a blustery cold day, with fierce winds pounding the small  vessel, the ship's pilot pulled anchor to sail across Matagorda Bay to get  help&mdash;violating La Salle's orders.&nbsp; In short order, he lost control of the ship. Dragging  its anchor, the ship was blown backwards until it smashed into a sandbar. As  dawn broke, the crew of <em>La Belle</em> knew they were in trouble. The ship would  never move again. The aft was driven firmly into the sandbar, and the front  part (bow) of the boat was starting to sink.&nbsp;  The crew was trapped and they did not have enough to eat or drink.</p>
<h3>Sinking Ship, Failing Dreams </h3>
<p>In desperation, several of the men made a crude raft of  crates and barrels tied together with rope and wire. They set out for shore to  get supplies, but the raft capsized. Many or all in this group drowned. Now  there were just a few left on board.&nbsp; The  captain finished off several kegs of brandy and would not leave, even though  the remaining sailors made another raft and set off for shore. Meanwhile,  another man lay in the bow of the boat.  Perhaps  he, too, had drunk too much brandy and passed out.&nbsp; Perhaps he was sick or already dead when <em>La  Belle</em> ran aground.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>Slowly, over several months time, the ship disappeared beneath the muddy waters if the  bay. In a final twist of bad fortune, La Salle himself was murdered at  the hand of one of his own men, an event which led the Karankawa to attack Fort Saint    Louis and kill most of the remaining French  settlers. A Spanish expedition, searching for the French men, found the remains of the fort, and the bodies of several of the settlers. The French threat on Texas' shores had passed. La Salle's dream had ended. </p>
<p>For 310 years, the <em>Belle</em> remained mired in the mud, untouched  but not forgotten. Historians and archeologists knew it was somewhere in Matagorda Bay, but they could not pinpoint the exact spot. In 1995, after years of unsuccessful searching, Texas State Marine  Archeologist J. Barto Arnold of the Texas Historical Commission finally found  the prize. Working with an underwater scanning machine (called a magnetometer),  a crew of divers began finding metal objects  beneath the muddy bay waters.  Finally, they brought up a brass cannon, an elaborately decorated gun that had  the mark of Louis XIV, confirming the age and identity of the wreck. It was the  French ship, <em>La Belle</em>! </p>
<p>But properly excavating the shipwreck would require one of the  most extraordinary engineering feats ever attempted in an archeological  excavation in Texas  or anywhere else in the world. At a cost of over $1.5 million, a stout  double-walled cofferdam was built around the sunken ship in 1996. This allowed  archeologists from the Texas Historical Commission to pump out the wreck site  and excavate the <em>Belle</em> almost as if they were on dry land.</p>
<h3>An Amazing Excavation </h3>
<p>The amazing excavation yielded equally astonishing results:  gooey gray mud had encased the <em>Belle</em> and sealed its contents off from  decay. Most of the ship's stores&mdash;wooden boxes jammed with trade goods, casks  lined with muskets, miles of woven rope, cannons, dishes, and more&mdash;were found  in remarkably good condition. Here, for the first time, was an intact 17th-century  French colonizing kit containing everything needed to establish a trading post  in the New World. Even the ship's hull and  timbers were still intact, water-logged and fragile, but still looking very  much like they did when La Salle last saw them.  The timbers still bore the original numbers scrawled into each piece to aid the  ship's builders in assembling the <em>Belle</em>. </p>
<p>In the bow section of the ship,  archeologists uncovered a skeleton, lying face down on a large coil of anchor  rope. A small barrel, perhaps at one time containing water or wine, was by his  side. Perhaps he had fallen from a bunk or hammock in this area where sailors  apparently went for rest. Perhaps he had died of thirst like several other  sailors on board. </p>
<p>The Texas Historical Commission's excavation was completed in  1997. Since then, more than one million artifacts have been cleaned, analyzed, and  conserved. At the Conservation Research Laboratory at Texas A&amp;M   University, researchers conducted yet another &quot;excavation,&quot; chipping away rust and heavy concretions from thousands of  wooden and metal artifacts from the <em>Belle</em>. The ship's hull has been reassembled in a giant vat filled with  water and a stabilizing compound that has replaced the water and  hardened the wet wood. It has taken almost nine years, but the reconstructed <em>Belle</em> is almost ready for public viewing in the new Texas  State History  Museum in Austin.</p>
<h3>Learn More </h3>
<p> In the meantime, you can visit <a href="http://www.texasbeyondhistory.net/belle.html" target="_blank">www.texasbeyondhistory.net/belle.html</a> to learn more about this lost ship and its sunken treasure. For archeologists  and others interested in Texas  history, the thousands of well-preserved artifacts and the ship itself  represent a far more valuable treasure than gold bars and silver coins. (Those  too, have been recovered from a shipwreck on the Texas coast, but that is another story.)</p>

<p>First they had to take a look at the sailor's DNA. We know that DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is present in every cell of the human body and can sometimes be used to help identify and match up family members. So scientists took samples of his brain tissue,  his right leg bones,  his teeth, and one of his ribs to look for his DNA. </p>
<p>All the samples contained DNA, but none of it was human! The sailor's DNA had been contaminated by bacteria and sea organisms that had been living on his skeleton for over 300 years!  So, unfortunately, scientists have not been able to genetically link our Mr. C. Barange with any modern-day relatives. Maybe new techniques will allow us to get better samples and help solve this puzzle some day in the future! </p></td>

  <p align="left" class="style4">The humerus can also be used to predict height.  Various scientists have studied different populations of people to chart the relationship between bone length and height.  In the 1890's, a study was made of French males linking the length of arm bones to height.  The information from this study helped scientists make a more accurate prediction of the height of the La Belle sailor because it is based on a group of people more like this individual than people living in the 21st century would be.  Similar information comes from studies of French soldiers in the 19th century and American prisoners of the War of 1812 being held in England.</p>   </td>

On the first molar, only the roots remained!  Although the back teeth were no longer there, the scientists could see that the jawbone had deteriorated because of the infected teeth.  Even the teeth that were attached to the jawbone were very decayed, and the man also showed signs of infected gums!</p>

(We believe that Native Americans swam out to La Belle to take some of the cargo as it slowly sank.) One reason we believe that this  individual was not Native American is because he did not have shovel-shaped  incisors, a characteristic common to people of Asian ethnicity, including  Native Americans.

    <td><p class="style5">Seventeenth-century Europeans did not know much about dental care, and the hardships of this sailor's life probably contributed to the poor condition of his teeth.  Because he no longer had strong molars for grinding, he had to chew his food with his front teeth, which showed signs of wear.  Eating was probably a painful task for him.  Growth arrest lines on some of the teeth indicate that the man had lived through at least two times when illness or poor nutrition had slowed the rate of his growth.  The upper canines and incisors, teeth used for biting, were bent outwards from the jawbone.  Perhaps the sailor had the habit of using his front teeth as tools to grip items such as rope when he worked! </p>
