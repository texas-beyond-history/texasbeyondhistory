						<em>Texas Beyond History</em> (TBH) is a public education service of the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) at the University of Texas at Austin, developed in collaboration with <a href="partners.html" target="_blank">many other organizations</a>. Begun in 2001, our enduring mission is to share the results of archeological and historical research on the cultural heritage of Texas. </P>

					<p>
						In this virtual museum you will learn about the multifaceted 15,000 year (or more) human legacy of the region known today as Texas. That is over 600 generations of people! No written history, books, or recorded eyewitness accounts exist for the vast majority of that immense time span. These unrecorded chapters of Texas’ cultural heritage are told with mute stones, ancient campfires, broken bones, and delicate traces of once-flourishing societies. This is the material evidence, the artifacts and features, upon which archeologists base most of their interpretations.</p>
						
					<p>
						The arrival of the first Spanish explorers in Texas in 1528 marks the beginning of Texas’ historic era, defined by the existence of written documents and drawings, upon which historians depend. <em>Texas Beyond History</em> covers not only the prehistory (before written documents) and history of Texas' diverse Native peoples, but also  the early history of the Spanish, French, Mexican, and Anglo explorers, missionaries, soldiers, miners, traders, and settlers. And more recent history, too—that of German farmers, Black freedmen, and Mexican-American laborers.</p>
						
					<p>
						Complementing the archeological and written historical record are oral histories passed from generation to generation and ethnographic accounts. These sources can impart invaluable and often-intangible information, such as cosmological beliefs, traditional uses of plants and other materials of the natural world, and how Native peoples and others shaped and settled Texas’ diverse landscapes.</p>

						</figure>
				
					<p>
						Our collective cultural heritage is complex, fascinating, and sometimes painful to recount. The sixteenth-century arrival of the Spanish, for instance, marks the beginning of over three-hundred years of often-brutal conflict between Texas’ Native peoples and the mainly European-derived immigrants. In a few short centuries, much of the Native population of Texas was decimated, and as a result, many oral histories and traditions were lost. However, some stories and traditions persist to this day, kept alive by the descendants of Native people who called this land home.</p>
						
					<p>
						<em>Texas Beyond History</em> is unique in its breadth of archeological and historical information about the state. By focusing on the broad subject of Texas' cultural heritage, we overcome the traditional boundaries between the disciplines of archeology and history. <em>Texas Beyond History</em> also bridges the bureaucratic and political fences between institutions of higher education, state and federal agencies, museums, and private organizations. By working in partnership and collaboration with dozens and dozens of individuals, institutions, and organizations, we help tell the stories of the peoples who have settled the land we call Texas. To do that we rely on specialists, expert in their field, as well as the documents and images that color the stories of the past with meaningful context.</p>
				
					<h2 id="guide">TBH Guide</h2>
					<p>
						Because Texas Beyond History is a massive compendium of Texas' archeology and history, an introduction to the different website features will help new users navigate its depths. The <a href="https://texasbeyondhistory.net/search.html#gsc.tab=0" target="_blank">search</a> tool at the top of most pages is a quick way to investigate TBH's 12,000+ pages and 30,000+ images. </p>
						
						<p>The <a href="https://www.texasbeyondhistory.net/explorer.html" target="_blank">Site Explorer</a> is a map-based feature which links to dozens of archeological site exhibits. It is a great tool for in-depth exploration of important sites in every region of the state.</p>
				
						<p><a href="https://www.texasbeyondhistory.net/prehistoric/index.html" target="_blank">Prehistoric Texas</a> is a map-based regional interface which presents a geographic, environmental, historic and prehistoric overview for four Texas regions (and counting). Each regional exhibit set contains many short site pages (Historic Encounters and Ancient Places) not found on the Site Explorer, as well as timelines, kids' activities, and so much more!</p>

						</figure>
						
					<p>
						The <a href="https://www.texasbeyondhistory.net/theme.html" target="_blank">Special Exhibits</a> section contains a variety of topical exhibits. For example, the <em>Learning from Cabeza de Vaca</em> Special Exhibit discusses the foods and food preparations of Native people as reported by the sixteenth-century shipwrecked Spaniard during his seven-year journey from the Texas Coast to Mexico City. Another Special Exhibit, <em>Radiocarbon Dating Understood</em>, explains the radiocarbon dating method to serious students of archeology and science lovers everywhere. <a href="https://www.texasbeyondhistory.net/spotlight.html" target="_blank">Spotlight</a>, a subsection of Special Exhibits, features remarkable items from TARL's collections as well as ongoing research at the lab. </P>
				
						<p>The <a href="https://www.texasbeyondhistory.net/gallery/index.html" target="_blank">TBH Gallery</a> is TBH's newest feature, going live in 2020. The Gallery highlights iconic artifacts and other physical materials illustrative of Texas´ cultural heritage. Whereas most TBH exhibits are centered on places, the Gallery focuses on particularly informative things—artifacts, natural materials, and patterned arrangements of things (archeological features). Check back for new additions to the Gallery!</p>
						
					<p>
						Texas Beyond History has long been a resource for kids and educators. The <a href="https://www.texasbeyondhistory.net/kids/index.html" target="_blank">Kids Only?</a> section contains activities and games, an illustrated archeology dictonary, and much more, all guided by Dr. Dirt, the armadillo archeologist! The <a href="https://www.texasbeyondhistory.net/teach/index.html" target="_blank">Teachers</a> section contains dozens of lesson and unit plans for Social Studies, Language Arts, Math/Science, and Art classes.

					<p>
						Founded in 1961, the <a href="http://www.utexas.edu/research/tarl" target="_blank">Texas Archeological Research Laboratory</a> (TARL) of the University of Texas at Austin is a nationally recognized archeological research facility and the largest archeological repository in the state. We are an organized research unit under the College of Liberal Arts at UT-Austin. Our mission is to collect, preserve, and curate archeological specimens and records, train students, conduct archeological research, and disseminate information about Texas' archeological legacy. As a repository, TARL safeguards the collections and records from literally thousands of archeological investigations conducted by UT-Austin and many other universities, state and federal agencies, and private firms across the state. Because we are not set up as a physical museum, <em>Texas Beyond History</em> serves as TARL's virtual museum and provides ready access to information and images about Texas archeology. Professor <strong>Fred Valdez</strong> of the Department of Anthropology is the TARL Director. TARL staff members support the website in many ways, from administration to collections and records management.</p>

He is also a writer and author of many technical studies as well as popular articles on several subjects including archeology. He is the author (with Kevin Jolly) of <em>Archaeology By Design</em> (Altamira Press, 2003), a practical guide to the process of planning and carrying out successful archeological research projects. In 2008 Black joined the anthropology faculty at Texas State University where he taught and directed the Ancient Southwest Texas Project, a research program in the Lower Pecos Canyonlands of southwest Texas. Steve retired from Texas State as an associate professor in 2019 and today serves a research professor continuing his Lower Pecos investigations. At TARL Steve continues to be the passionate leader of TBH.</p>
