					<em>Texas Beyond History</em> (TBH) began as a partnership between the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) and the Texas Archeological Society (TAS). Since the website's inception in 2001, many other partner organizations have become instrumental to the success of the project. </p>
					
				<p>
					Legacy Partners are those that lent critical support for TBH in the website's earlier days. Sustaining Partners are those that continue to generously give to TBH today, allowing TBH add new content and revitilize existing content. Institutional Partners provide content, matching grants and sponsorships. Underwriters are foundations, individuals, and agencies, and organizations who have provided significant one-time donations or grants. Sponsors are organizations who have funded TBH exhibits as part of education and outreach efforts. Each TBH Partner, Underwriter, and Sponsor has a vested interest in preserving and sharing Texas' cultural heritage.</p>
				
					
					<h2 id="sustaining">Sustaining Partners</h2>
					
				<p>
					Sustaining Partner organizations keep the <em>Texas Beyond History</em> engines running. These organizations include private consulting firms with cultural resource offices, state and regional archeological societies and associations, and non-profit organizations which regularly provide TBH with resources or content. Funds from sustaining partners are used to create new content and refresh the staggering amount of existing content, match grants and donations, and help assure TBH has essential funding for staff.</p>
