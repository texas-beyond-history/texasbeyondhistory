    <td width="368"><p align="left">Unlike the arid, richly painted Lower Pecos Canyonlands to
	   the northwest with its extraordinarily well preserved dry rockshelters, the South Texas Plains
	    region has yielded only glimpses of the creative artistry of its native peoples. Poor preservation 
	    conditions and geology are the main culprits that account for this scarcity. The south Texas brush 
	    country is a land of gentle topography and silt-laden streams that cut through clay-derived or 
	    sandstone substrates. It is only in the region's northwestern reaches-on the limestone outliers 
	    south of the Edwards Plateau and along the Del Rio to Laredo section of the Rio Grande- that we
	     find the resistant bedrock bluffs and overhangs that served as stone canvasses upon which ancient
	      peoples painted symbolic representations of life and belief. Further, the alternating dry-wet 
		  climate of southern Texas has taken a toll on many artistic expressions, even on stone, further
		   accounting for the rarity of surviving expressions of art. </p>
	      <p align="left">Yet we know the peoples of the region employed various media for their creative and symbolic
		    expressions. On sandstone outcroppings, on marine and freshwater mussel shells, on stone pipes,
		     and smooth pebbles, we find traces of their work. Other evidence comes from accounts in Spanish 
		     journals of the 17th and 18th centuries which tell of another mode of expression-the often
		      elaborate body ornamentation of native peoples.  Here we call these diverse representations 
			"artistic expressions," but we are mindful that many of these depictions were laden with 
			  religious, social, and personal meanings that are lost to us today.  Western conceptions of
			 "art" rarely convey the integral roles that crafted designs played in the lives of native 
		     peoples.</p>
		     <p align="left">In the section following, we take a look at a selection of documented examples of artistic 
			   expressions from archeological sites in the South Texas Plains and from accounts in early 
		     historic documents. </p></td>

		     <H3 align="left">Ornaments and Decorated Objects - "Portable Art"</H3>
		     <p align="left">In contrast to rock art, comparatively numerous examples of ornaments and decorated 
			   objects fashioned by native peoples have come from archeological sites across the South 
			   Texas Plains. These run the gamut from bird-bone beads to tubular smoking pipes carved from 
			   stone and decorated with geometric designs to smooth pebbles adorned with painted or engraved 
			   designs. Some of these items accompanied burials at cemetery sites and clearly represent 
		     grave offerings that had special meanings to the deceased and their loved ones. </p>
		     <p align="left">Ornaments-or what we today might call jewelry-include pendants (or gorgets), and beads
			    made of shell, bone, and stone. At the Morhiss site, a small cemetery in Victoria County, 
			    archeologists found two strings of beads-apparently necklaces. One was made of hollow bird 
			    bones which had been grooved (incised with a sharp stone tool), then snapped into smaller 
			    sections which were then smoothed and polished to form finished beads. The other "necklace",
			    placed in the burial of a male, was made of dozens of vertebrae from adult diamondback 
			    rattlesnakes.  Given the placement of this artifact at the knees of the deceased, it may
			    not have been a necklace.  But the vertebrae were obviously strung together and apparently
		        worn from use; perhaps the string of snake vertebrae was attached to a leather garment or
		      bag.</p>
	        <p align="left">Freshwater mussel (clam) shells, with their gleaming opalescent interiors, were favored
			   materials for prehistoric artists. Cut and shaped into various forms, the shells became 
			   pendants, beads, or "danglers" which were strung on a cord through small drilled holes. 
			   Pendants frequently were decorated with designs, including intricate geometric patterns 
		     and punctations. </p>
		     <p align="left">Marine shells, especially the Lightning Whelk (Busycon perversum pulleyi) and several
			    other species of conch shells, were also worked into ornaments and are sometimes found 
			    whole as well far from the coast.  The large spiraling conch shells were highly valued 
			    by the native peoples of the South Texas Plains (and far beyond).  This value can be seen
			    by the elaborate shapes into which conch shell pieces were carved, by the diverse range
			    of ornament forms into which they were fashioned, and by the fact that conch shell artifacts
			    are commonly left as grave offerings. Given its prehistoric importance, it seems most
		      appropriate that the Lightning Whelk is now the official Texas State Shell.</p>
		      <p align="left">In prehistoric times, conch shells were often used by coastal peoples to fashion everyday 
			    tools such as gouges, scrapers, dippers, and perhaps small bowls.  But the shells traded or
			    carried inland seem to have been used almost exclusively as ornaments and symbols. Lightning
			    whelk shells were used in two particularly striking ways.  Broad cup-like sections of the
			    outer shells were shaped into ovals pendants or gorgets (chest pieces) suspended from 
			    cords around the neck.  Some conch gorgets have elaborately carved or drilled designs.  
			    The other section of the lightning whelk shell that was often used is the central axis or 
			    columela. Drilled through and suspended in a dangling fashion, these long, pieces, sometimes 
			    left with visible spirals, sometimes smoothed to tubular shapes, would have been quite 
		      distinctive.</p>
		      <p align="left">Small stones and smooth pebbles also caught the eye of native artisans looking for 
			    available craft materials. Flat pebbles were used as is and sometimes even shaped and 
			    ground along the edges to create elongate triangles, rectangles and other shapes. Some 
			    had holes drilled through one or both ends, transforming the stones into pendants or other 
		      ornaments.  Other pebbles were left whole and had painted designs.</p>
		      <p align="left">Painted and or sometimes engraved pebbles are common in the Lower Pecos Canyonlands, 
			    but they do occur on the South Texas Plains.  Technically, these stones fit within the size 
			    range known to geologists as cobbles, but archeologists call them pebbles. These are 
			    stream-worn stone pebbles (cobbles) that are small enough to be held comfortably in your 
			    hand.  They are usually fairly flat rocks that are oval or elongated in outline shape.  
			    Shaped by nature, they quite purposefully chosen hard, thin limestone pieces of the sort 
			    commonly found in gravel bars along the streams and rivers that drain the Edwards Plateau 
		      as well as along the middle stretches of the Rio Grande. </p>
		      <p align="left">Although rare, painted pebbles are known from the South Texas Plains, especially in the 
			    northwestern part of the region where the raw materials (smoothed pebbles) can be found in 
			    many streambeds. This apparent scarcity is probably attributable mainly to poor preservation 
			    conditions - painted designs seldom survive in open archeological sites. Even in the dry 
			    rockshelters of the Lower Pecos archeologists sometimes fail to notice the often-faint 
		      traces of designs.</p>  
		     <p align="left">The meanings of the painted pebbles are debated, but archeologist Mark Parsons has argued 
			    that these are representations of human beings, some more abstractly than others.  
		      Some examples from the Lower Pecos clearly depict humans.</p> 
		     <p align="left">A much different design was executed on a tiny, oval-shaped pebble found on the surface 
			   along San Miguel Creek in Atascosa County. Although there was no obvious evidence of shaping 
			   by pecking or grinding, a series of deeply engraved lines on all surfaces seems to give the 
        artifact the appearance of a shell.</p></td>

	and hair pins, as well as carved stone smoking pipes, although the latter are quite rare. Several 
	decorated pipes have been reported as surface finds along the lower Rio Grande. The example shown is 
	of fine-grained sandstone with deeply incised designs, varying from wavy to zig-zag lines, running the 
	length of the object.</p>
	<p align="left">Another pipe fragment, found at the Hinojosa site in Jim Wells County, is even more unusual. The 
	short, cylindrical fragment of a sandstone pipe bears traces of a bold curvilinear design executed in 
	red ocher and black asphaltum (natural tar). Although recovered from the surface of the site, the 
	sandstone pipe is attributed to a Late Prehistoric artist.</p>
	<p align="left">Some of the most remarkable traces of prehistoric artisanship can be found on bone objects used as 
	tools, ornaments, and even musical instruments.  Most bone tools aren't decorated, but some pointed 
	awls (weaving tools?) and needles do have incised designs.  Curving, flattish bone pieces thought to 
	be hair pins often have intricate incised designs in checkerboard patterns and spirals. There are also 
	examples of incised rasps or bones that have sets of deeply incised parallel lines that produce a 
	rhythmic sound when rubbed with a stick or another bone.   One final, most peculiar type of bone 
	ornament is worth mentioning - decorated sections of bone fashioned from human bones.  These are rare 
	and known mostly from along the Rio Grande. It does not take any imagination to suggest that such 
	objects had special ritual significance - perhaps these were made from the bones of enemy peoples.</p></td>

    <td width="368" valign="top"><h3 align="left">Rock Art</h3><p align="left">Although bedrock bluffs and overhangs are rare throughout most of 
	the South Texas Plains, there is surviving evidence in the northwest portion of the region that native 
	peoples took advantage of these natural "canvasses."</p>
	<p align="left">Sites with painted rock art panels,<strong><em> Pictograph</em></strong> sites, are very rare in the region for the reasons 
	noted above. The Old Sullivan Springs site (41WB56) in northwestern Webb County is one of the few documented 
	examples known in the region (other pictograph sites are known from adjacent northeastern Mexico).  
	The pictograph panel at Sullivan Springs measures roughly 13 feet (4 m) wide by nearly 5 feet (1.5 m) 
	high in some areas. The painted designs were executed in shades of red and yellow on a wall beneath a 
	sandstone overhang overlooking the Rio Grande River. The motifs are largely vertical zig-zag designs, 
	although there is a central anthropomorphic figure with what may be a horned headdress. The figure appears to have both arms extended and wears a horned headress. Archeologist 
	Thomas R. Hester, who recorded the site, notes its proximity to a large spring that is associated with 
	several nearby campsites, one of which also contains several bedrock mortars and grinding surfaces - 
	modified bedrock with an obvious utilitarian purpose. According to Hester, visitors to the site in the
	 mid-20th century recalled seeing smaller rock art panels nearby; these may have been destroyed since by floods 
	 and weathering.</p>
	 <h3 align="left">Body Art</h3><p align="left">Early explorers traveling through south Texas occasionally made note of the 
	 appearance and customs of  native peoples, including the often elaborate tattooing,  painted designs, 
	 and piercings with which they ornamented their bodies. Although there clearly were different reasons 
	 for ornamenting the body, including ritual painting for ceremonies and raids, or tattooing to denote 
	 group affiliation, these adornments were a form of artistic expression.</p>
	 <p align="left">There are several accounts of the body art of the Coahuiltecan groups of south Texas. In Cabeza de 
	 Vaca's  journal, La Relación, we learn that the Yguazes, a sub-group of the Coahuiltecos, "have both 
	 a nipple and lip bored." Tattoos were common on Coahuiltecan men and at least some of the women.   
	 Coahuiltecan boys were tattooed during ceremonies marking the passage from childhood to adulthood. 
	 Herbs were rubbed on to numb the skin, then shallow incisions were made with sharp flakes or animal 
	 teeth. These cuts then were rubbed with charcoal and resin. Captives were often tattooed as well. 
	 Fernando del Bosque noted that a Spanish boy brought to him by a Gueiquesale Inidan had "a line on 
	 his face marking him from his forehead to his nose, and two lines on his cheeks, one on each, and 
	 rows of them on his left arm and one on the right."</p></td>
