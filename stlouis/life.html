    <div class="caption">Situated on a high point on the banks of Garcitas Creek, the small French settlement later to be known as Fort St. Louis  consisted only of a two-story building made of salvaged ship timbers, a chapel, and some small jacal structures.

      <p align="left">Once La  Salle had settled on the site for his temporary colony, the major undertaking  became moving people and property from &ldquo;Grand Camp&rdquo; on Matagorda Island.  La Salle remained at the new site on the <em>Riv&igrave;ere  aux Boeufs </em>(River   of Beefs; modern-day Garcitas  Creek).&nbsp; In early June 1685, Grand Camp  was vacated except for Joutel and thirty men. They were to load the remaining  property on the <em>Belle</em>,which was to be unloaded  near the mouth of Lavaca   Bay and taken then by canoe or the <em>Belle</em>&rsquo;s shallop. Seventy colonists, meanwhile, undertook a grueling  50-mile march up the west shore   of Matagorda Bay. This  group included Madam Talon and her 10-month-old baby, Robert, born during the  crossing. The mother had her two daughters, ages 12 and 13, to relieve her of  carrying the infant. The toddler Lucien, age 3, trotted alongside, aided by his  two older brothers, who were 6 and 10. (No mention is made at this point of  Lucien Talon <em>p&eacute;re.) </em></p>
      <p align="left">&nbsp;There were also six girls or young women, at  least some of whom had been taken from the brothels of Paris. Otherwise, the procession was made up  of young men and boys: tradesmen, soldiers, and service personnel, as well as  adventurers who had come seeking opportunity in the new land. No account  survives of this long walk, but the people surely had to take wide detours  around bayous and snake-infested marshes, often wading, constantly in dread of  Indian attack. &nbsp;</p>
      <p align="left">Arriving at  their new home, on a bluff overlooking the Riv&igrave;ere aux Boeufs, they found  little comfort. Joutel, who reached the place by canoe in July, found the only  shelter to be a staked enclosure where the powder was kept. Disappointed at the  lack of progress, he saw dry and sterile seedbeds, unprotected from the rooting  and trampling of swine; everything in &ldquo;a miserable state.&rdquo; &nbsp;Illness and death were everywhere.</p>
      <h3 align="left">The Struggle for Shelter<a name="shelter"></a></h3>
      <p align="left">Housing was  the urgent need. The nearest suitable timber for building was a league away;  there were no carts or draft animals to move it. La Salle,  nevertheless, put men to work felling trees and squaring logs while others  stood guard against Indians. At first, men dragged the timbers over the three  miles to the building site, a near impossible feat that overcame even the  strongest. Then a gun carriage was employed, but it, too, was difficult to move  through the tall, matted grass. La Salle,  distressed that the effort did not succeed as he wished, became ill-tempered  and abusive. Joutel later wrote, &ldquo;I can testify that [this work] caused the  death of more than thirty people, as much from the punishment they received as  from the affliction.&rdquo; </p>
      <p align="left">Whereas La  Salle himself acknowledged the loss of half his people within less than six  months after his arrival on the Texas  coast, he blamed the men themselves. Incapable of discipline, he alleged, they  took unto themselves the means of their own destruction.</p>
      <p align="left">At last  Joutel was permitted to return to Grand Camp to build a raft for transporting <em>l&rsquo;Aimable</em>&rsquo;s salvaged timbers, which  proved more useful than all the logs brought from the woods at such a heavy  cost. A house with four rooms was built in the Canadian style, the thin planks  used as roof decking and covered with bison hides. One of the rooms was La Salle&rsquo;s lodging; another for the R&eacute;collet fathers; the  third for some of the gentlemen volunteers, the fourth for storage. The rest of  the people, Joutel related, were &ldquo;almost without shelter.&rdquo; Such was the lack of  consideration accorded the rank-and-file colonists, who are seldom mentioned in  Joutel&rsquo;s journal. Assigned to keep the official record, he assiduously  prevented others from writing. Two factors influenced the content of his  account: his loyalty to La Salle that  prevented his writing anything that might be disagreeable to the leader; and  his military training that led him to consider only persons of rank. In  consequence, much is suppressed.</p>
      <p align="left">Natural  forces conspired to diminish numbers in the small settlement. One of La Salle&rsquo;s key officers died from gangrene, the result of  an infected wound caused by a snakebite. The Sieur Le Gros had stepped on a  rattlesnake while hunting at Grand Camp. Amputation, performed by the surgeon,  was not successful, and sealed his fate.</p>
      <p align="left">Prowling Indians kept the colonists on edge, and La Salle ordered his men to fire at them on sight. A state  of warfare had existed ever since a deadly confrontation arose from the Indians  pillage of the <em>Aimable</em>&rsquo;s stores that  had washed ashore and the Frenchmen&rsquo;s seizure of native canoes. During the  building of the settlement, Indians approached in threatening posture several  times but were always put to flight. Then a band of fourteen Karankawas  attacked three men who had gone out hunting. In danger of being overcome, one  of the men, with a lucky shot, killed a chief; the Indians withdrew.</p>
      <p align="left">With the settlement fairly well established, La Salle planned to board  the <em>Belle</em> to seek a way to the Mississippi, still  believing a branch of the big river emptied into the bay complex where he had  placed the people. Intending to move his colony to the Mississippi when he found it, he loaded the <em>Belle</em> with provisions the colonists  depended on for their existence, even to a litter of six-week-old pigs. Then,  leaving Joutel in charge of the post, he departed on the last day of October  1685. </p>
      <p align="left">In typical La Salle fashion, he soon  allowed a host of diversions to keep him from his purpose. First, he pursued a  band of marauding Indians to their village, where he found artifacts suggesting  Spanish presence in the area. Back at his camp near the ship, La   Salle found some of his men had died from eating prickly-pear tunas without removing  the tiny thorns. He ordered the <em>Belle</em>&rsquo;s  captain to begin sounding a channel for entering Lavaca Bay,  while he and his men explored the bay&rsquo;s perimeter. Returning toward the ship in  late December, he came upon the bodies of the sounding party&mdash;the ship&rsquo;s captain  and five others&mdash;all slain by Indians. Leaving the bibulous Tessier in command  of the <em>Belle</em>, La Salle, with 20 men, departed early in  January on a mysterious journey to the west, apparently seeking  knowledge of the Spaniards and their mines. </p>
      <p align="left">During La Salle&rsquo;s long absence from the  post, lodging was built for the soldiers and workmen and for the women and  girls. Trees were cut farther up the Rivi&egrave;re aux Boeufs and brought by boat a  few at a time when hunting trips were made. Walls were of logs or stakes,  placed side by side on end and plastered with clay mixed with a lighter top  soil to prevent cracking. Roofs were thatched with reeds that grew along the  streams.</p>
      <p align="left">Somewhat later, plans were made to erect a palisade, or fence, around  the settlement for protection, but the necessities of daily living intervened;  the palisade was never built. Joutel, when left in charge, confronted both the  environmental strangeness and the lack of provisions.&nbsp; The colonists were without meat, as the  entire supply had been placed on board the <em>Belle</em>.  Their sustenance consisted of a daily bread ration and an occasional helping of  soup made from a piece of salt pork and doled out sparingly. </p>
      <h3 align="left">Hunting and Gathering<a name="hunting"></a></h3>
      <p align="left">Food became more readily available as hunting skills improved. Whereas  the buffalo, or bison,  became the staple, other game animals and birds rounded out the fare. There  were deer, turkeys, prairie chickens, waterfowl, and various shore birds. When  the bison herds came near the camp, Joutel assembled his best marksmen, but  none knew anything about hunting the shaggy beasts. Joutel himself fired time  after time into the herd, breaking the shoulder of several animals without  bringing one down. The huntsmen crawled on hands and knees to get within range,  only to have the animals catch their scent and scatter. At the end of a long  and tiring day, his knees raw from crawling, Joutel came upon the still-warm  carcass of an animal that had fallen out of his line of vision. The butchering  extended the day well into the night, for no one had experience. Gradually, the  men developed their skills, and there was plenty of meat. Still, it was not the  end of difficulties on the hunt.&nbsp; </p>
      <p align="left">Both Father Anastase Douay and Father Z&eacute;nobe Membr&eacute; suffered crippling  accidents when charged by a wounded buffalo. In each instance, the clerical  robe impeded flight, and both fathers were trampled severely. There were other  accidents, from different causes. Father Maxime Le Clercq was attacked by a  boar. The vicious beast gnashed his arm, severing tendons and rendering his  fingers useless. </p>
      <p align="left">It was P&eacute;re Maxime&rsquo;s misfortune also to become lost; he spent a cold  night in the open before finding his way back to the settlement. One of the  girls, after helping the hunters dress the kill, was left behind and spent two  nights alone in the wilderness. It is said that Lucien Talon <em>p&eacute;re</em>, father of the six children, had  been &ldquo;lost in the woods&rdquo; while on a journey with La Salle  and was never heard of again.</p>
      <p align="left">Fear of the Karankawas intensified concern for the lost ones.Sentries were posted at each corner of  the house. Indians stalked about the settlement and staked the nearby spring  with arrows, signifying their claim and a warning to violators. Around the  settlement, trees large enough to obstruct the view were cut down. When long  hunting trips were made and the hunters had to make camp for the night, a brush  barricade was thrown up  so that no one could approach without detection.</p>
      <p align="left">Joutel, the gardener&rsquo;s son, observed the native flora and compared or contrasted it to that  of Normandy.  The temperate climate with &ldquo;almost no winter&rdquo; favored the mulberry trees that  grew along the stream and produced a fruit that was sweeter, though smaller,  than the mulberries of France,  as were the wild blackberries. &nbsp;The grapevines that climbed  to the treetops produced a fruit that was sharp to the tongue and unsuitable  for wine, though the verjuice added zest to soups and stews. </p>
      <p align="left">Domestic plantings fell short of success at first. When the beans  planted in February failed to sprout, it was thought the seed had been wet with  sea water during the crossing. Wheat fared no better. Chicory, beets, celery,  asparagus, melons, and pumpkins, sewn in scattered plots to test the soil, came up well,  but the lack of fences to keep out the pigs doomed the plantings to failure.</p>
      <p align="left">The post was a happier  place when La Salle was absent and  Joutel in charge. The surrogate commander, by his own account, strove to  maintain an orderly, yet relaxed, routine. Soon, however, La   Salle returned from his westward trek to face a dire situation.  The <em>Belle</em> was missing and could not  be found. The colony was stranded, with no means of carrying out La Salle&rsquo;s design and no means of escaping this trackless  wilderness.</p>
      <h3 align="left">La Salle Seeks Help<a name="lasalle"></a></h3>
      <p align="left">His options narrowed, La Salle decided on an overland journey to Canada; from that point he would to send to France for aid.  In late April 1686, he chose 20 companions and departed on an eastward course.  Joutel again remained in charge of the post. Short of provisions, the surrogate commander  was forced to send out huntsmen to look for game, leaving the settlement with  few persons to defend it. Everyone had to take a turn at standing sentry; the  women and girls, trained in the handling of firearms, soon took their turn as  well as the men and boys. </p>
      <p align="left">A few days after La Salle&rsquo;s departure,  the Abb&eacute; Chefdeville and five companions&mdash;the only survivors of the 27 men who  had been assigned to the <em>Belle</em>&mdash;reached  the post to report the loss of the ship in a sudden squall. The six were warmly  received and fed; Joutel records his regret at the loss of the ship&rsquo;s cargo but  says nothing of the crew. Death of comrades seems to have become the accepted  norm. Eventually, Gabriel Barbier would visit the wreck to recover some of the  goods.</p>
      <p align="left">During this time, the colonists undertook various projects for the improvement  of their lot but, because of the strangeness of their environment and the  exigencies of their daily living, hardly any were completed. A plan to stop  roof leaks at the house by covering it with elm bark died with the discovery  that the bark would strip from the trees only when the sap was rising. A cellar  begun for storing meat never reached completion because of the heavy soil and  the lack of workers. It was the same with a plan to erect a log palisade; the  few logs gathered finally were used for a less ambitious project.</p>
      <p align="left">Joutel&rsquo;s garden plantings on the riverbank somehow escaped the pigs,  only to fall prey to rats and rabbits. The several pumpkins that did survive to  maturity were consumed by an alligator. A lack of familiarity with the seasons  doomed other plantings to failure; cotton planted too late grew well, only to  have the plants killed by frost.</p>
      <p align="left">During the long months without news from the marchers, discontentment  spread through the colony. La Salle, it was  widely believed, would never return. Pierre Duhaut, who had often played the  role of troublemaker, incited the discontent. Joutel, on learning of the  plotting, let him off with a reprimand&mdash;leniency that he later regretted.</p>
      <h3 align="left">Death and Desertions<a name="death"></a></h3>
      <p align="left">La Salle returned in October, having traveled no farther than the Caddoan tribes of  eastern Texas.  Of the twenty men who had gone with him, only eight returned. Of the other  twelve, four had deserted. One man had been pulled down by an alligator while  crossing a stream. Five others had become ill and were given leave to return to  the colony but never arrived. Seemingly on a more positive note, La Salle  brought five horses laden with corn and beans&mdash;a temporary benefit outweighed by  the dire omen implicit in his return. Before beginning anew, he must take from  the already enfeebled colony replacements for the twelve men he had lost. Why  indeed had La Salle returned to the settlement when he was already halfway to  the Mississippi?</p>
      <p align="left">He began immediately to plan a new attempt to reach the Illinois post. While he  waited for autumn heat to pass, he urged the planting of the seeds he had  brought from the Caddoan tribes. Inasmuch as previous plantings had proved  fruitless for lack of protection from the pigs, men were detailed to cut stakes  for enclosing the garden&mdash;one project that actually was completed. Barbier&rsquo;s  hunting party, meanwhile, had a run-in with Indians near the post. The natives  withdrew, carrying one warrior, dead or severely injured. Not long afterward,  they wrought vengeance on a Frenchman who was gathering firewood scarcely a  musket shot from the post, shooting three arrows into his body.</p>
      <p align="left">As preparations moved forward for his new journey, La Salle  chose from the diminishing ranks those who would go and those who would stay,  unfortunately choosing the trouble-maker Duhaut as one of his companions.  Seventeen men would follow him toward the Mississippi;  twenty-three would remain in the charge of Barbier, who had been lamed on La Salle&rsquo;s earlier march by a thorn in the foot, and who  had married one of the young women. Left to guard the settlement, by Abb&eacute;  Cavelier&rsquo;s account, were &ldquo;missionaries, women and children, and the disabled.&rdquo; The twenty-three and the  seventeen, plus five deserters sojourning among the Indians, were all who  remained of almost two hundred left with La Salle when the <em>Joly</em> sailed for France.  </p>
      <p align="left">With all in readiness, the Christmas season was observed, the Feast of  Kings celebrated with toasts drunk with water; the wine was long since gone. On  January 12, 1687, the seventeen men took their leave &ldquo;from the habitation  situated on the Rivi&egrave;re aux Boeufs, near the Baye Saint-Louis&rdquo;&mdash;the ragged and  destitute little colony that was never deserving of, and never was given, the  name &ldquo;Fort Saint Louis.&rdquo;</p>
      <p align="left">Joutel derides the account of a later writer that a fort was built and  put in a state of defense. This, he says was purely imaginary, for &ldquo;there was  only the house . . . , having eight cannon at the four corners, . . .without  cannonballs, and . . . when we left there was nothing else in the nature of a  fort.&rdquo; Nor was there when the Indians came. </p>
      <h3 align="left">A Brutal End<a name="end"></a></h3>
      <p align="left">No full account exists of life in this meager enclave on the bluff  overlooking Garcitas Creek. We know only that the months dragged by without  word from the marchers. A year passed, then two. No messenger came; hope faded into hopelessness.  Had their been news of La Salle&rsquo;s &ldquo;rescue mission,&rdquo; it would have been more  disheartening still, for the leader was dead, shot down by the evil one,  Duhaut, the willing instrument of a conspiracy among La Salle&rsquo;s followers.  Duhaut himself was dead, from a falling-out among the conspirators. Following  this bloodletting in eastern Texas, Joutel,  the Abb&eacute; Cavelier, and three others eventually reached France, but too late to send help  to the beleaguered colonists.<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
        As for the settlement on Garcitas Creek, the only account of the final  episode comes from the interrogation years later of Jean-Baptiste Talon, an eyewitness at  the age of ten. He recalled how &ldquo;the savages named Clamco&euml;hs [Karankawa]&rdquo; had first  come offering friendship. Then the Indians learned of La   Salle&rsquo;s death and the disunity among the people in the settlement.  The French, believing the natives friendly, were no longer on guard when the  Indians came again. The massacre that followed was complete except for young  Talon, his two younger brothers, an older sister, and a young lad, previously  orphaned, named Eustache Br&eacute;man. </p>
      <p align="left">After the Talon children had seen their mother slain, the native women,  moved to compassion by their youth, carried them away on their backs while the  Indian men finished the slaughter. The women also had taken away Madame  Barbier, who had a three-month-old baby at breast, but, when the Indian men  returned from the massacre, they killed her. Then the infant, whose given name  and gender are not known, was held by a foot, its head bashed against a tree.  The other children &ldquo;were reared and &nbsp;&nbsp;loved  by these same savage women . . . as if they were their own. . . .&rdquo;&nbsp; </p>

    <td width="480" height="1307" valign="top"><p align="left">The Spaniards of New Spain, meanwhile, had sought La   Salle&rsquo;s colony for four years, with six land expeditions and five  sea voyages. On the bleak and rainy morning of April 22, 1689, General Alonso  de Le&oacute;n, leading a troop from Coahuila, came upon the ruined settlement. He  noted the six houses, the lack of defensive works, and the eight  cannons&mdash;without cannonballs&mdash;which he later buried for archeologists to find,  three hundred years later, in the exact same spot. Le&oacute;n also mentions a  planting of corn and an herb garden of endive and asparagus, enclosed by the  picket fence erected during La Salle&rsquo;s last  visit. He found and buried the bodies of three massacre victims. One, with a  dress still covering the bones, was that of a woman, the fatal arrow still in  her back.</p>
      <p align="left">From young Talon&rsquo;s brief account and De Le&oacute;n&rsquo;s description, the dreadful  scene of the massacre day may be imagined: the chilling Indian yells; the  fearful cries of women and children; the chanted litany of R&eacute;collet friar and  Sulpician priest; the moans of the dying; and the shrill squeals of pigs as  arrows were shot into them too. When no life remained but the swine that  scurried off into the wilds, there was the sound of cracking wood, as the  Indians smashed furniture and broke off the stocks of the muskets La Salle had  brought for the arming of his native allies for the conquest of northern Mexico. Then the  Indians in their frenzy tore apart books, and leaves of manuscripts, now  rendered illegible, that might have told a more poignant story than can ever be  imagined.</p>
      <p align="left">By the evening&rsquo;s firelight, the massacre site fresh in mind, Juan  Bautista Chapa, the expedition&rsquo;s historian, composed an elegy of three stanzas.  The first stanza addressed the &ldquo;sad and fateful site.&rdquo; The final one bespeaks  the affront to Spanish sovereignty implicit in the French invasion of territory  granted to Spain  by the 1494 papal bull of Alexander VI. It is the middle stanza that reveals  the writer&rsquo;s emotions upon finding the three skeletons, especially that of the  woman with the fatal arrow still in her back:

      <p align="left">On this journey and two others that followed, the Spaniards gathered up  the French children&mdash;including 12-year-old Pierre Talon who had gone with La  Salle and was left among the Hasinai&mdash;and took them to Mexico.&nbsp; Also taken were three other young men who had  been left by the small group that succeeded in returning to France after La Salle&rsquo;s  murder; these three became settlers in Spanish New Mexico. The Talons, finally  repatriated to France,  later took part in the exploration and settlement of French Louisiana.</p>
      <p align="left">Failure of La Salle&rsquo;s enterprise was  written into its very concept: in the unknown geography; in the leader&rsquo;s confused  priorities; and in the blind ambition of others for wealth and status. Yet, despite  La Salle&rsquo;s failure, the results of his  endeavor are everlasting. They are seen first in the impetus his intrusion gave  to Spanish exploration and settlement of the Gulf region; then the ambitions of  France to take advantage of  his discovery with settlement of the Mississippi   Valley. From these  forerunners arose the United States of America  as we know it today, forever stamped by the influences of both France and Spain.</p></td>
