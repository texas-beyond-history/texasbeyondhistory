    <td width="480"><p align="left">Almost from its beginning, La Salle&rsquo;s  little colony on the Texas  coast excited the curiosity of other people interested in its whereabouts.&nbsp; Officials of New Spain  were especially anxious, and, from 1686 to 1689, they launched five seaborne  searches and six overland expeditions to find the intruders and drive them out  of Spanish territory.&nbsp; By the time they  were finished, the Spaniards had located wreckage of two of La Salle&rsquo;s ships,  the remains of the colony known today as Fort Saint Louis, and a few straggling  French survivors&nbsp; among the Indians of  what is now eastern Texas. The doomed French incursion prompted Spain  to establish a thin line of missions among the eastern Indians.&nbsp; By 1720, that buffer required reinforcement,  and Spain again looked in  the direction of Matagorda Bay, this time as a location for a new mission and  presidio&mdash;the latter to be built on the site of Fort Saint Louis. </p>
      <p align="left">All of this activity produced maps,  journals, reports, and other documents pertaining to the location of La Salle&rsquo;s colony.&nbsp;  But the site lost its importance when the mission and presidio were  relocated several miles inland, and knowledge of the colony&rsquo;s location  disappeared into the archival underbrush of French and Spanish records. By the  early 1900s, American historians were stumped by the mystery of Fort Saint    Louis.&nbsp;  Historic maps presented a multiplicity of confusing and seemingly  contradictory place names, the result of the ignorance of Texas  geography that had bedeviled both La Salle and  his Spanish pursuers.&nbsp;&nbsp; The consensus of  scholars at the turn of the 20th century was that the colony had  been located on the Lavaca River, above the head of Matagorda   Bay.&nbsp; It was believed to  have been on the eastern bank, although there was an argument for the west side  of the river.&nbsp; There even was a belief  that it was nowhere near Matagorda Bay at all, but was, rather, on Galveston Bay.</p>
      <p align="left">In the summer of 1914, University of Texas history professor Herbert E. Bolton  set out to answer the question.&nbsp; Armed  with a journal and map from a 1690 Spanish expedition, Bolton traveled to the Victoria County  ranch of Claude Keeran to investigate the banks of Garcitas Creek, a stream  which, like the Lavaca River, flows into Lavaca  Bay a few miles above Matagorda Bay.&nbsp;  There, he toured the site of what was known locally as &ldquo;The Old  Mission,&rdquo; and noted a scattering of small fragments of blue and white Spanish  pottery, as well as the remains of an old wall. Made of baked clay blocks some  2.5 feet thick, the wall seemed to enclose a roughly 90-square-foot area which  Bolton believed was related, not to a mission, but to the Spanish presidio  built atop the remains of Fort   Saint Louis.&nbsp; The historian was convinced that he had found  the site of La Salle&rsquo;s colony.&nbsp; But he had not found any direct evidence of a  French presence at the Garcitas Creek site, and his conclusion was disputed for  many years.</p>

    <td width="480">
      <p align="left">Continuing questions about the  Garcitas Creek location were addressed in 1950 when geologist Glenn Evans of  the Texas Memorial  Museum in Austin was hired to investigate the site, which  by then had been named after landowner, Claude Keeran, and been given the official site trinomial 41VT4. Over a period of roughly three months, Evans  and a small crew cleared cacti and brush off a large area and dug a series of  trenches and excavation units to try to understand the nature of the deposits. The  workers encountered large concentrations of historic European refuse&mdash;glass and  ceramic fragments, hand-made bricks, lead musket balls, gun parts, rusted  knives, lead seals, a silver medallion, copper utensils&mdash;as well as Native  American objects, including arrow points, stone pipes and pottery. Of particular  interest were what Evans described as the remains of packed-earth house floors.  These features were given fanciful names derived from artifacts: &ldquo;Ring House,&rdquo;  &ldquo;Coral House,&rdquo; &ldquo;Slate House.&rdquo; &nbsp;Having  uncovered thousands of artifacts and what he believed were the remains of  several structures, Evans was confidant he had proven the location of the  French fort and the Spanish presidio at Garcitas Creek.&nbsp; Unfortunately, perhaps because funding ran  out for the project, the artifacts were not analyzed and a report of findings was  never issued. Debate over the location of Fort St. Louis  continued for another two decades. </p>
      <p align="left">In the early 1970s Ed Jelks and  Curtis Tunnell of the Office of the State Archeologist &nbsp;approached Kathleen Gilmore about analyzing  the pottery and other materials excavated earlier from the Keeran Site. Gilmore  had recently completed her master&rsquo;s thesis on the San Xavier Missions, and she  had developed a keen interest in the Historic Period of Texas. With hopes of settling the issue of  the identity of the site, the Dallas  archeologist took on the task of searching through the thousands of artifacts recovered  from the 1950s excavations for remains of the French colony. Mindful of the  difficulties in sorting 17th-century European manufactured goods, she  determined to concentrate on the pottery from the site. It seemed probable, she  later stated in her report, that French ceramics of the time period could be  more effectively isolated from Spanish ceramics than could other kinds of  artifacts, such as French guns and gunflints that could have been traded and  used by others than the French. </p>
      <p align="left">Amid hundreds of fragments of  Spanish blue-and-white <em>majolica</em> and  other pottery, Gilmore found&nbsp; several  dozen green-glazed sherds, unlike anything she had seen before. A  Canadian researcher concurred with her opinion that they were  French rather than Spanish&mdash;a  clear indicator that the site was La Salle&rsquo;s settlement, Fort St. Louis. In her  1973 report, Gilmore presented her findings, comparing them to conceptual models  she had set forth of what the French and Spanish occupations should look like.  &nbsp;Over the next several years, she became more convinced  of what she had found and published an article in the <em>Bulletin of the Texas Archeological Society</em> establishing the  significance of her analyses. &nbsp;</p>
      <p align="left">Subsequent archeological  investigation would benefit from archival research that uncovered other  important documents.&nbsp; The map and journal  that Bolton had relied on were from the third  Spanish expedition to have visited the site.&nbsp;  The first, led by General Alonso de Le&oacute;n in 1689, had discovered the remains of La Salle&rsquo;s colony several months after the Karankawa attack. The Spaniards had made a rough  locational sketch of the French buildings and eight cannons; they also had  buried the remains of three French settlers. Thirty-three years later,  fearful of further French incursions,   provincial governor Marqu&eacute;s de San Miguel de Aguayo embarked on an  expedition to shore up the east Texas missions and to establish the presidio  Nuestra Senora de Loreto de la Bah&iacute;a on the site of La Salle&rsquo;s colony.&nbsp; According to Spanish records, work on the new  presidio had been undertaken in the spring of 1722, based on an elaborate design ordered  by Aguayo.&nbsp; </p>
      <p align="left">Both the 1689 sketch map of the  French buildings and cannons, and Aquayo's 1722 plan map of  the presidio, would  become critical clues when, in 1996, a Keeran ranch employee uncovered portions of an iron  cannon near the area of the 1950s excavations.&nbsp;  A Texas Historical Commission (THC) crew led by the agency&rsquo;s executive  director, Curtis Tunnell, investigated the find and made an even more remarkable  discovery: seven additional cannons.&nbsp; The  number matched those depicted in the sketch map made by the Spanish more than  300 years earlier. They were clearly the cannons La Salle&rsquo;s crew had salvaged  from the wreck of the ship, <em>Aimable</em>,  and brought inland to guard his fort, the same ones discovered,  documented, and buried by the Spanish. The location of La Salle&rsquo;s Fort St.    Louis was no longer in question. </p>
      <h3 align="left">Facing  Challenges<a name="facing"></a>      </h3>
      <p align="left">Interest in the small site  remained high, and in 1999 a major investigation that was to span two  and a half years was launched at the site  by the THC. The investigators hoped to determine the nature of the deposits at  the Keeran site and to weigh the accuracy of historic accounts against what lay  in the dirt. </p>
      <p align="left">According to THC Project Director  Jim Bruseth, the archeologists anticipated several complicating problems from  the outset. Because the Historic Period occupations at the site had been relatively  short&mdash;spanning only a few decades&mdash;there would likely be relatively low artifact  density.&nbsp; What artifacts there were would  likely be mixed, because the site had been repeatedly disturbed. Further, native coastal  people had pillaged the site following their attack on the French settlers, and  the Spanish had razed and burned the remains of the structures, reportedly taking  everything of value back to Mexico.  In more recent times, collectors had periodically visited the site, digging holes and  removing untold numbers of artifacts. &nbsp;The  1950s excavations, although conducted in a more systematic approach, had been  only scantly documented and sediments were not screened. Artifacts had been catalogued with only a general provenience according to unit. </p>
      <p align="left">Historical accounts were used to guide the THC  investigations, but these resources also raised questions.&nbsp; A journal from the Aguayo expedition told of  the construction of the presidio directly over the ruins of the French  settlement. The Spanish plan map of the presidio depicted three concentric rows of buildings of buildings  surrounded by a complex, 16-point star-shaped palisade wall. &nbsp;To the researchers, the elaborate design  seemed grandiose, given the presidio&rsquo;s remote location. They wondered whether  the elaborate fortification actually had ever been constructed, or if the map had  been simply a propaganda ruse to deceive hostile governments about Spanish strength  in the area. </p>
      <p align="left">Once test excavations were underway, however, archeologists realized that perhaps the most  problematic challenge of all was the dirt itself. The soil in the area was a heavy  clay which, particularly during times of drought, was hard packed and homogenous. According to one archeologist, it was like &ldquo;digging  through concrete.&rdquo;  Worse, they found it  nearly impossible to discern subtle changes in soil  color and texture which might indicate human activity. Further, there had been  little accretion, or build up, of soil over time at the site, meaning that  artifacts and traces left by earlier cultures potentially were mixed with those  of later peoples. As summed up more graphically by archeologist Jeff Durst, &ldquo;The  surface that La Salle stood on was the  same that prehistoric Indians stood on 5,000 years before.&rdquo; </p>
      <h3 align="left">Surveying Beneath the Surface<a name="surveying"></a>      </h3>
      <p align="left">To address some of these problems  and gain a better understanding of what lay underground, a magnetometer, or  remote sensing, survey was conducted. This rapid survey method entails dragging  a wheeled cart holding magnetometer sensors across the surface of a site. Capable  of taking up to 10 readings per second, the instruments detect magnetic  disturbances below the soil surface that may have been caused by past human  activity, such as digging post holes or pits for fires or trash. &nbsp;In Historic Period sites, iron and other  ferrous metal also can be detected.&nbsp;These  various data are compiled into computer maps of magnetic patterns, providing a  means of &ldquo;seeing&rdquo; beneath the surface to determine the size and layout of sites,  even before a single shovelful of dirt is dug. </p>
      <p align="left">The first magnetometer survey  covered the roughly 4-acre area that had been investigated by Evans in the  1950s.&nbsp; The resultant maps showed an  intriguing and complex set of anomalies, ranging from large concentrations of  disturbances to small dipole anomalies characteristic of ferrous metal  scattered across the site. On  gray-scale computer maps, dipoles appear as black and white spots, representing both high and low ends of a magnetic pole. In one area, the small dipole signals formed a  clear pattern, a roughly circular ring measuring about 88 yards (80.5 meters) in diameter. When  compared to the Aguayo map of the Spanish presidio, the magnetic ring seemed to correlate to the concentric rows of structures encircling a central parade  ground, or plaza.</p>
      <p align="left">Using this information, the  archeologists began small test excavations to determine the nature of the anomalies and obtain a sample of artifacts. A number of Spanish colonial artifacts, including metal, burned clay, and sherds of blue and white Spanish majolica dishes was recovered. This diverse range of artifacts likely represented trash that was dumped by the Spanish soliders outside their huts. Unfortunately, no traces of structures were discovered during testing. For this reason, the THC archeologists decided to use artifact patterns to guide their search. </p>
      <p align="left">Digging  inside the ring area, they found a series of postholes and stains as well as large  amounts of trash, including a number of iron artifacts. They excavated quantities of burned clay, which they believed was daub. According to Spanish  accounts, a series of <em>jacal</em> buildings had been constructed to house the soldiers. The jacales had been made of upright wooden poles set into the ground and covered over with clay to seal out moisture and provide  insulation. The main  difference between what was found in the excavation and what was depicted on  the historic map was that there had been only a single ring of jacal buildings,  rather than the three circular rows shown.&nbsp; </p>
      <p align="left">Once the building remains had been  located, the archeologists began their search for the remains of the  star-shaped palisade fence depicted on the map. The magnetometer survey had  failed to detect signs of this elaborate feature, likely due to a lack of  magnetic contrast in the clay soils. By superimposing the map of the presidio  onto the magnetometer map, however, the investigators could more accurately determine  the scale for the presidio and estimate the distance from the jacales to the palisade.  This gave them a more precise starting point to begin searching for the remains  of the palisade trench. Since there was no way to know the correct orientation  of the Spanish map in relation to the site, however, there were countless  possibilities for locations of individual wall sections, depending on the  rotation of the 16-point star.</p></td>

    <td width="480"><p align="left">Months of excavation ensued with  no success until a series of rains ironically broke both an area drought and  the archeologists&rsquo; &ldquo;dry holes.&rdquo; Moisture from the rains made subtle contrasts  in the soil horizons more visible, enabling crewmembers to detect a dark,  linear soil discoloration in one of the excavation units.&nbsp; On closer inspection, the darker area proved  to be a series of post molds.&nbsp; More  digging revealed additional sections of the original Spanish setting trench and  the discovery that the palisade had, indeed, followed the exact 16-point star  shown on the map. </p>
      <p align="left">Roughly in the center of the  compound area, crews found the remains of  an adobe structure. Intact portions of mortared walls coated with plaster and  charred fragments of the wooden roof were uncovered in what had been the  building interior. A surface of&nbsp; &ldquo;shell  hash&rdquo; had served as an entryway into the structure, of service particularly during rainy periods.</p>
      <h3 align="left">Clues to the French Settlement
        <a name="clues"></a></h3>
      <p align="left">If historic accounts were correct,  the remains of Fort   St. Louis should lie  underneath the presidio, or in close proximity. Excavators probed the clusters  of magnetic anomalies to the north, generally outside the ring of the main  presidio area. These dipole signatures turned out to be metal artifacts,  including quantities of slag, pieces of cut copper, and thousands of small iron  fragments. It appeared they had found an intensive activity area&mdash;likely the spot  where the French colony&rsquo;s blacksmith had worked refurbishing copper kettles,  making iron tools from iron bar stock, and other materials needed in the settlement.&nbsp; There also were large quantities of charcoal,  which likely had come from his forge. &nbsp;</p>
      <p align="left">Just to the south, hundreds of  other French artifacts were found&mdash;distinctive French gunflints, lead shot,  trade goods such as glass beads, and pottery sherds. The remains of the setting  timbers of two walls of a structure also were found, and these correlated to  the crude map of the French fort drawn by the De Le&oacute;n expedition in 1689. The  diary of La Salle&rsquo;s lieutenant, Joutel, indicates the structure was built in an  L-shape design, using sturdy  timbers salvaged from  the <em>Aimable</em>. The archeologists also uncovered  traces of the French chapel, and several smaller dwellings.&nbsp; </p>
      <p align="left">Once the excavation data were  overlaid on the magnetometer map, clear conjunctions were evident. Most Spanish artifacts were located in the perimeter of the presidio complex.  Materials related to the French occupations lay to the north, although some  features had been covered over by the construction of the presidio. Traces of  aboriginal pottery, chipped-stone tools, and other non-European artifacts roughly  encircled the presidio complex, suggesting coastal peoples&mdash;likely the&nbsp; Karankawas&mdash;had camped outside the stockade,  perhaps to engage in trade with the soldiers. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      <h3 align="left">Three Burials<a name="three"></a>      </h3>
      <p align="left">Excavations at the Keeran site conclusively  established the location of La Salle&rsquo;s  settlement and the later Spanish presidio.&nbsp;  What still remained a mystery, however, concerned the remains of the numerous  French settlers who had died at Fort   St. Louis, either at the  hands of the Karankawa or because of disease and other deprivations. In  November 2000, archeologists uncovered the skeletons of three individuals. The skeletal  remains were disarticulated, suggesting they had lain exposed to the elements  for some time prior to their burial.&nbsp; </p>
      <p align="left">&nbsp;Based on analysis &nbsp;by R. Gil King of North Texas   University, one skeleton  was that of a white female, 25-35 years in age; a second was a male, 30-45  years old, and the third a boy, somewhere between 7 and 10 years old. The  female had suffered a massive blow to the skull.&nbsp; The adult male had two blunt force injuries  on his skull as well as a perforation injury. A study of the teeth of the  adults showed changes in the enamel caused by either periodic bouts of  malnutrition or infections that sapped protein from the body. There also were  indications the adult male had suffered from syphilis.</p>
      <p align="left">It appears fairly certain that  these three skeletons were those discovered&mdash;and subsequently buried&mdash;by members  of the De Leon expedition in 1687 while doing reconnaissance at the ruined  French settlement.&nbsp; Their accounts describe  finding three badly decomposed bodies&mdash;a woman and two men&mdash;lying in a field near  the chapel ruins. The woman had been shot in the back by an arrow; fragments of  her dress still clung to her bones. The Spaniards said mass over the remains  and buried them, an experience which moved one soldier, probably expedition  historian Chapa, to pen a poem about the woman who had been so cruelly murdered  in the Texas  coastal wilderness. It is possible she was  Isabelle Talon, mother of several children in the colony. </p>
      <p align="left">Although accounts indicate more  than 50 colonists died at the settlement, no other burials or remains of a cemetery  were found. &nbsp;During the three-year  investigations, THC archeologists mounted an extensive search and survey over a  broad area, testing and trenching a roughly 40-acre area. Most archeologists  involved in the search believe it highly unlikely they would have missed a  cemetery area if it were in reasonable proximity to the settlement. </p>
      <p align="left">There are several theories,  however, about why no other remains were found. One is that the dead were  buried near the edge of the bluff overlooking Garcitas Creek. Over the  course of some 300 years, trees may have been uprooted naturally and fallen  over after heavy rains, causing the bluff edge to cave into the creek. According  to Durst, several large oaks met such a fate during the time they worked at the  site. Other THC researchers believe that, because the settlement was never  intended to be the permanent site for the colony, a cemetery was never  established and that the bodies of individuals who died there may have been weighted  down and deposited in the river for disposal. Finally, some local historians  believe that there was a cemetery, and it remains to be discovered. </p>
      <p align="left">One other element of the site eluded archeologists: traces of  Mission Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora Esp&iacute;ritu Santo del Z&uacute;&ntilde;iga that, according to reports, was established in 1722 across the creek from the presidio and the site of Fort St. Louis. Here Spanish priests set out to christianize and convert the local Indians. Just as the French had failed in growing crops, so did the Spanish and their native charges. Throughout, the Karankawa  resisted this effort and violence ensued. Scarcely a year passed before the misison was moved inland to a more favorable site on the Guadalupe River (see TBH exhibit on <a href="../espiritu/index.html" target="_blank">Mission Esp&iacute;ritu Santo</a> to learn more).  Across Garcitas Creek, scatters of Spanish artifacts were found but no definitive evidence of the mission, and this may have been due to the brevity of its presence. </p>

      <p align="left">Spanning two and a half years, the  investigations at the Keeran Ranch site uncovered a wealth of information about La Salle's  settlement and the Spanish Presidio La Bah&iacute;a, bridging the gap between 300-year-old  documents and what was left behind in the dirt. Excavators confirmed Henri Joutel's descriptions of the French structures       as well as the layout of the little settlement shown in the map drawn by the De Le&oacute;n expedition. Archeological evidence also bore out Spanish accounts of   burying eight  French cannons as well as the bodies of French settlers killed by the Karankawa</p>
      <p align="left"> As regards the Spanish occupation, the archeological work confirmed that the  presidio  had been built according to the elaborate plan drawn by the Marqu&eacute;s de Aguayo and had been garrisoned with soldiers to guard against the return of the French. Traces of the Karankawa were found throughout the site as well, raising intriguing questions. Distribution of native artifacts strongly suggested that the Indians had not only traded with the French but lived just outside&#8212;if not within&#8212;the walls of the presidio during the time of the Spanish. </p>
      <p align="left">Project archeologist Jeff Durst notes that the  unusual length of time spent excavating allowed for continual reassessment of  findings in the field. &quot;We had different interpretations of what we were seeing as we went along, changing about every three weeks as we made new discoveries. We looked for the Spanish palisade wall trench for about a year before we found it. We had begun to think that the Spanish map of the presidio with the 16-sided wall was just propaganda put out at the time. Had it not been for that extra length of time we spent in the field, we might never have found it.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">A comprehensive report of findings  from the excavations and  analyses of artifacts is being prepared by THC  archeologists and contributing researchers.&nbsp; &nbsp;In addition to the technical report, an  illustrated book for general audiences also is planned.</p>
