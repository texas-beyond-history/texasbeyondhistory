		<title>Tom Cook’s Clinching Bar</title>
		<meta name="description" content="This flat and tapered piece of iron, simple as it is, is part of a long-lost story of life along the Chisholm Trail in North Texas. This clinching bar is one of the 25,000 artifacts recovered from the archeological excavation of farrier and blacksmith Tom Cook’s shop. Tom Cook (1840-1898) was a freedman, a formerly enslaved African American. As a free Texan in the late nineteenth century, Tom Cook not only owned his own blacksmith shop, but he raised a family and became an integral member of the community, influencing later generations of North Texans, including some living today. This TBH Gallery piece discusses the significance of this archeological artifact.">

Howard joined the archeological crew and helped uncover the features and artifacts at the Tom Cook Blacksmith Shop from September 2020 to February 2021. Following in the footsteps of his ancestor, Howard has been learning blacksmithing, studying under the direction of professional blacksmith Kelly Kring (back to camera in right photograph). At right, Howard demonstrated blacksmithing techniques at the Denton Juneteenth Festival in 2023. Photographs by Doug Boyd.
