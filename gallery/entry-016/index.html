			  <p>This flat and tapered piece of iron, simple as it is, is part of a long-lost story of life along the Chisholm Trail in North Texas. This clinching bar is one of the 25,000 artifacts recovered from the archeological excavation of farrier and blacksmith Tom Cook’s shop. Tom Cook (1840-1898) was a freedman, a formerly enslaved African American. As a free Texan in the late nineteenth century, Tom Cook not only owned his own blacksmith shop, but he raised a family and became an integral member of the community, influencing later generations of North Texans, including some living today. </p>

				<p>Tom Cook’s blacksmith shop was in Bolivar, a small town along the Chisholm Trail, the famous cattle drive route stretching from South Texas to the railroads in central Kansas. Tom Cook provided important services for travelers as well as for local community members working on their farms and homesteading across the Texas frontier. Archeologists working for Stantec Inc. brought to light the remains of his shop during excavations for the Bolivar Archeological Project, a Texas Department of Transportation project, in 2020-2021. The site and clinching bar are among many important archeological finds made because of road construction projects, as Texans balance building for the future with appreciating and learning from the past. </p>

				<p>While not all farriers are blacksmiths, and not all blacksmiths are farriers, Tom Cook was both. What is a farrier? Farriers work with horses, removing and re-applying iron shoes, mending old shoes and producing new shoes, and filing and cleaning hooves. Farrier work involves the use of essential common blacksmith tools and equipment, such as the anvil, a hammer and hot-cut chisel or hardy, in addition to a range of specialized tools specific to farrier work. Tools for making and fitting horseshoes and shoeing horses include a range of tongs, other punching tools, files and rasps, butterises (a tool to trim a horse’s hoof before shoeing), hoof knives, hoof picks and parers, and shoe spreading tools, among others. In addition to the clinching bar, excavations on the Tom Cook site recovered a broken hoof nipper, another farrier tool used to trim hoofs.</p>
				
				
				
				<p>The clinching bar, also called a “clinch” or “clinch block,” would have been held by the farrier, serving as a hand anvil to “draw the shoe tightly against the hoof” as they drove a horseshoe nail through the hoof at a particular angle; this wouldn’t hurt the horse if done properly since a hoof is insensitive like a fingernail. The clinching bar protects the farrier’s hand when nailing horseshoes.  The distal nail ends are bent when the farrier drives then through the shoe and hoof. The end hits the clinching bar and bends, and then the farrier cuts off the protruding nail, and then files it down until it is smooth with the hoof edge. </p>

				<figcaption>Photographs of a horseshoe (top left), a muleshoe (top right), and horseshoe nails (bottom) from the Tom Cook site. Most of the horseshoe nails have been clinched, meaning that ends were bent and cut off during the process of fitting an iron shoe on a horse or mule. Many worn-out mule- and horseshoes were found at the site, along with an abundance of horseshoe nails and even the clinched distal (pointy) ends of horseshoe nails. The iron artifact assemblage demonstrates that horseshoeing was an important part of Tom Cook’s work, as would be expected at a nineteenth-century blacksmith shop on the Texas frontier.

			<p>During Tom Cooks’s life, industrialization was in progress across much of the United States, and mass-produced items began to replace hand-made craft items. As a blacksmith and farrier, Tom would have at times made many of his own tools, and at times acquired and used mass-produced tools, such as those advertised in the late nineteenth century catalogs of Sears and Roebuck Co. and Montgomery Ward & Co. Tom probably forged this clinching bar specifically to fit his hands and his style of horseshoeing. The clinching bar measures 7 7/8 inches in length, and the main bar is tapered, measuring 1 and 5/8 inches wide by the handle and tapering to 3/8 inches at the end. The proximal end of the specimen is narrow and appears to be broken, and it is likely that it once had an integrated curved handle that could be hooked onto a belt for easy access.</p>

				
			<p>Blacksmiths have been integral to communities across the globe and throughout world history. Ironworkers and blacksmiths were viewed as having great power and significance for their abilities to transform and move hot metal, from ancient Africa and Europe to the Americas and beyond. Before the automobile, horses and work animals were essential for transportation and as beasts of burden. The hoofs of work horses employed to carry heavy loads across rocky landscapes and along stone paths were well worn. Consequently, societies throughout time have crafted ways to care for and support horse’s hoofs. For instance, excavations of Roman sites have recovered a variety of horseshoes that were called “hipposandals” (from the Greek hippos for horse) and were “crescent-shaped iron sandals,” according to author of The Blacksmith, Ironworker and Farrier, Aldren Watson. Moreover, blacksmiths and farriers also had to cultivate a practice to effectively manage and care for a horse while shoeing, which often included talking to the horse. Because of this special relationship with horses, village blacksmith-farriers often served as local veterinarians as well. </p>

			  <p>As horses gave way to the automobile, farriers and blacksmiths became less common. Interestingly, the first auto mechanics were trained as blacksmiths. In 2024, an African American freedman blacksmith and inventor named Reeves Henry was recognized with a Texas Historical Commission Marker (No. 23482) acknowledging that he was the first auto mechanic in Texas history!</p>
				
			 
				
			  <p>Although the archeological team working at the Tom Cook site had over 100 years of combined experience, none of them were blacksmiths or farriers, so they had little idea of what exactly this metal artifact was when they first found it. It was identified thanks to a collaboration with professional blacksmith Kelly Kring (one of countless artifacts he helped identify.</p>

Howard joined the archeological crew and helped uncover the features and artifacts at the Tom Cook Blacksmith Shop from September 2020 to February 2021. Following in the footsteps of his ancestor, Howard has been learning blacksmithing, studying under the direction of professional blacksmith Kelly Kring (back to camera in right photograph).

			  <p>The identification and historical context of Tom Cook’s clinching bar highlight the importance of collaboration and learning together. As part of the Bolivar Archeological Project, archeologists collaborated with Tom Cook’s descendants, who connected the archeologists with the African American community in Denton County, and assisted in oral history research. Howard Clark, the great, great grandson of the blacksmith Tom Cook, even joined the archeological crew and helped excavate the blacksmith shop. Clark took up the practice of blacksmithing to honor his ancestor’s legacy—reminding us, the past is never past!</p>
