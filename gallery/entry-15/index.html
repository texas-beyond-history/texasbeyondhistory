			  <p>In Texas, abandoned wooden country houses are familiar sights, often dilapidated, daylight shining through cracks in the walls and broken windows. Curious passersby have undoubtedly wondered what stories these old houses could tell or what the area was like when the house was new. Archeologists excavated just such a house a few miles north of the small town of Farmersville in Collin County, a Blackland Prairie farming community northeast of Dallas. The Redwine House was built by Joseph and Fannie Redwine in 1870 on a ridge overlooking tributaries that flow into the headwaters of Groves and Lee creeks. The modest farmhouse stood through dramatically changing ways of life, from the post-Civil War period until it collapsed in 2010. The Redwine House is the oldest archeologically excavated farmstead in Collin County. Its material remains, from the bois d’arc timber foundation to the brick-patched sandstone chimney, echo the story of the farmers who lived there and the trajectory of economic development in the region.</p>

				<p>In the nineteenth-century, especially after Texas’ independence from Mexico (1836) and after Texas statehood (1845), Anglo-Americans flocked to Texas from the southern United States, seeking cheap land and opportunity. Almost half of Texas’ population lived in the northeastern part of the state by the mid-1800s, and farming was the region’s economic foundation. In 1846, the Collin County population was 150.  Most of these were small family farmers like the Redwines. In the 1870s, railroads came to Collin County, providing transportation for crops to market. The railroads brought an economic boom to the region which persisted for 50 years, until the Great Depression. Throughout, small farms remained economically important, with over 6,000 family farms in the county by the 1920s. Their crops, including corn, wheat, cotton, and later, onions, were all transported by rail.</p>
				
				
				<p>Joseph and Sarah Frances “Fannie” Wilcoxson Redwine were Anglo-Americans who moved to Texas from Virginia and Tennessee, respectively. The 1860 census records indicate that 15-year-old Fannie was living in Collin County with her parents that year, and 24-year-old Joseph was in nearby Fannin County, reportedly  employed as a teacher. The two married, and in 1870 purchased their five-acre Collin County parcel. A small cabin was probably still standing on the parcel when the Redwines purchased the property, as the remnants of an older stone hearth and mudcat chimney were found by archeologists beneath an addition to the Redwine house.</p>

				<p>The Redwines’ modest three-room house (the later addition made it four, for a total of 745 square feet) is unique in northeast Texas for its bois d’arc (<em>Maclura pomifera</em>) timber foundation. The bois d’arc tree (French for bow-wood), a member of the mulberry family, is believed to have grown in the Red River area of northeast Texas, Oklahoma, and Arkansas prior to European colonization. It is among the finest woods for creating hunting bows, as it is both strong and flexible; it was used and traded for this purpose by the <a href="https://www.texasbeyondhistory.net/tejas/" target="_blank">Caddo</a>. Before the invention of barbed wire, bois d’arc was planted as a living fence, especially in the southern states, and is now found across most of the United States. Bois d’arc timbers were commonly cut into fenceposts and railroads ties. Posts and logs for these purposes were produced in the Farmersville area, making it a readily available material for local builders. Bois d’arc timbers were among the early exports from the region by rail.</p>
				
				 
				
			  <p>Early the next year, Wendorf returned to excavate long trenches with the aim of understanding the geological stratigraphy and chronology of the bones and cultural material. Ed Moorman, an archeologist on the River Basin Surveys in Texas, was invited to assist, and Dr. Claude C.  Albritton, a geologist from Southern Methodist University, joined to profile the excavation trenches. They recorded complex white, grey, and red sands, containing not only stone tools and the bones of many species of Pleistocene animals, but also burnt caliche features which may relate to cooking. </p>

			  <p>Wendorf described his final return to the Midland site, in late 1955, as a salvage effort. The previous year paleontologist and then Director of the Texas Memorial Museum, E.H. Sellards, trenched and graded portions of the site with heavy machinery. In the archeologists’ estimation, he destroyed portions of the site by unsystematically moving a massive amount of sand during this work. Sellards’ professional transgression gave Wendorf reason to revisit the site and search for final clues that would put the geology, faunal, floral, and cultural material in sequential order. In the end, Wendorf and Krieger disagreed over the final interpretation of the sands and the traces of a Pleistocene world within them. </p>

				<p>Between 1989-1992, the site was again probed by scientists seeking to understand the stratigraphy of the colored sands, and the relationships between the archeological materials. Archeologists David Meltzer and geoarcheologist Vance Holliday identified a previously unrecognized stratum and confirmed the complexity of interpreting the sands in relationship to the stone artifacts and bones.  </p>
				
			  <p>Though the curious “unfluted Folsom” points were known from other sites before the Midland site was found by Glasscock, the Midland point was recognized as a formal typology as a result of work at the Midland site. Since, Midland points have been identified at sites across the Great Plains, especially its southern reaches. The Midland point’s relationship to its more-famous cousin, Folsom, has become better understood through meticulous study by lithic analysts. Today, they are regarded as a separate point type, made and used by the same people who made Folsom points.</p>

			  <p>Midland points are distinguished from Folsom points by collateral flaking (inward from the long edges) which extend past the point’s centerline, creating a flat profile, typically less than 4 or 5 millimeters thick. Folsom points, on the other hand, are shaped by flaking which terminates in the middle, creating a ridge along the centerline which helps direct the energy from the flintknapper’s blow during fluting. Fluting, the removal of a channel flake from the base of the point along most or all of its length, is one of the last steps in fluted point manufacture. Challenging to execute, many a point has been broken in the process, frustrating flintknappers today as it must have in millennia past. See <em>TBH</em>'s <a href="https://www.texasbeyondhistory.net/st-plains/prehistory/images/earliest.html" target="_blank">Earliest Peoples</a> exhibit for descriptions and illustrations of Folsom and Clovis fluted points.</p>

			  <p>Flintknapper and lithic analyst Dr. Robert Lassen studied over 800 Folsom period points and point blanks, including Midland points. In addition to finding the expected types, he found hybrids of them, such as points which are characteristic of a Folsom on one face and a Midland on the opposite. From this, Lassen surmised that Midland and Folsom points exhibit “innovation and adaptation” by their makers.</p>

				<p>The reigning hypothesis regarding the relationship between Midland and Folsom points is that they were made by the same people, and that the Midland point was probably an adaptation born of stone supply stresses, where the risk of breaking a point during fluting could not be suffered. However, evidence for Midland points dating to slightly later than Folsom has been found at the Winkler-1 site on the Texas-New Mexico border. And so, the Folsom-Midland debate continues, as it has since Midland points were first typed by Wendorf and his crew.</p>

				
				
				<p>Like the West Texas sands, questions still swirl around the relationship and age of cultural materials at the Midland site. The Midland point, at least, has been firmly planted in the minds of archeologists as a hunting technology developed during the Folsom period, or perhaps the late Folsom period, likely by cautious flintknappers when the break-prone Folsom point proved a risk not worth taking. </p>

Barth is involved in both local and state archeological societies and is a steward with the Texas Archeological Stewardship Network. His retirement in 2019 has allowed for more time to focus on his interest in the Paleoindian period on the Llano Estacado. Dr. Robert Lassen is an archaeologist and Principal Investigator at AmaTerra, ERG Texas Services. He specializes in lithic technology, particularly from the Paleoindian period, with his MA work exploring Clovis caches and his Ph.D. work focusing on Folsom technology. </p>
