			  <p>Archeologists recovered this small, hand-cranked sewing machine at the site of a late 19th-century hotel in Bolivar, Denton County, Texas. Bolivar was a prominent town on the Chisholm Trail, a famous cattle drive route between Texas and Kansas, as well as along stagecoach and mail routes. Travelers streaming through Bolivar needed a place to stay, and many were accommodated at the Sartin Hotel. </p> 
				
				
				
				<p>The Sartin Hotel was likely established sometime in the 1870s, certainly by 1881, and was in operation through 1899, if not later. The hotel’s namesake, Jesse Sartin, was the building’s second owner and he ran the hotel for many years.  Sometime in the early 20th century, the two-story wooden structure was abandoned, fell into ruins, and was removed. By the late 20th century, the Sartin Hotel site was all but forgotten. </p>

				<p>The Texas Department of Transportation sponsored excavations at the site of the Sartin Hotel in the fall and winter of 2020-2021. Archeologists from Stantec, Inc. were contracted to lead the project, but these highly trained experts neither found nor identified the artifact. North Texas Archeological Society members volunteering on the site found it while screening machine-excavated fill. Upon its discovery, no one had any idea what the diminutive, corroded iron hoop was. Months later, back at Stantec’s archeology lab, professional blacksmithing consultant Kelly Kring hazarded a guess. “I think it’s a sewing machine,” he said hesitantly.  A few hours of internet sleuthing later, Stantec archeologists verified Kring’s assertion - this unusual object was confirmed to be the Secor Sewing Machine Company’s “Fairy” model.</p>

				<p>The Fairy measures a diminutive 6 inches wide and 5 inches tall and sits upright on a round base. Its body is a circular cast iron frame with a horizontal plate, and several gears and shafts moved the sewing needle when the crank was turned. The specimen recovered from the Sartin is missing its crank handle and the bottom clamp that would attach it to a table. </p>

				
				
				
			<p>The Secor Sewing Machine Company was founded by a famous toy maker, Jerome B. Secor, and operated in Bridgeport, Connecticut from ca. 1876 or 1877 to 1883 (various sources disagree on the founding date, but all seem to agree the company ceased operations in 1883). The Fairy sewing machine, known as the Secor Fairy model, may look like a toy, but it was a highly portable and fully functional, affordable, hand-cranked sewing machine that could be clamped onto any flat table or bench. J. B. Secor filed for a patent on October 5, 1882, and his Fairy was granted U.S. Patent number 282,674 on August 7, 1883 and an additional U.S. Patent (number 286,336) was granted to him on October 9, 1883, for a “Sewing Machine Tension” mechanism. In the description for Patent number 282,674, Secor claimed: </p>
			
			<p> <em>My invention is a sewing-machine constructed, as fully described hereinafter, in order to reduce the cost of manufacture and secure such a simple and effective structure as will enable the same to be sold at a lower price than those made in the ordinary manner.</em></p>

Secor of Bridgeport, Connecticut, filed October 5, 1882, and issued August 7, 1883 (left and center). On the right is Patent No. 286,336, filed January 24, 1883, and issued October 9, 1883. As described in the patent text, this patent was for “an improved tension device for sewing-machines.” Comparing the Sartin Hotel find to these drawings, the archeological specimen from the Sartin Hotel is missing the large round gear and handle, the vertical needle mechanism, and the C-clamp on the bottom.

			<p>Among sewing machine collectors, the Secor Fairy model is acknowledged as a rare item. Images and descriptions of well-preserved originals reveal “it is made [of] cast iron, wood and brass, and it was operated by a hand crank that also moved the walking foot to advance the material,” as described by Mike McLeod in his post on “Southeastern Antiquing and Collecting Magazine.”</p>

			  <p>As with many archeological finds, the Fairy leaves us with more questions than answers. How did this Secor sewing machine end up in the archeological deposits at this late 19th-century hotel site in Bolivar, Texas? Who owned and used the Secor Fairy sewing machine? Perhaps this remarkably portable machine belonged to a traveler who accidentally left it behind or intentionally discarded it after it broke. Or perhaps clothing repair was one of the services the hotel offered its traveling patrons, and it was discarded by hotel staff after it broke. Or, was it lost and damaged years after the hotel was abandoned and gone?  Was the sewing machine still functional but was abandoned because it had become obsolete, and its owner no longer needed it?</p>
				
				
				
				
			  <p>Throughout its history, the story of Bolivar has been intimately tied to transportation. The Sartin Hotel, like Bolivar itself, owed its existence to the presence of roads, stagecoach lines and mail routes, and the Chisholm Trail. Bolivar was a crossroads frontier town, and these transportation routes brought travelers to the doorstep of the Sartin Hotel.</p>
				
			
				
			  <p>The Sartin Hotel was fondly remembered in the early decades of the twentieth century by former residents of Bolivar. They recalled the hotel as a “rambling,” two-story, L-shaped, wood-frame building. A few people recalled the Sartin Hotel had a flowing well or “duck pond” in the hotel lobby, but these details could not be verified through period archival records or archeological evidence. No photographs of the Sartin Hotel, interior or exterior, have been found so we have no way of knowing exactly what it looked like.</p>

		  <figcaption>From the descriptions of the Sartin Hotel and the archeological remains, we can surmise that the Sartin looked somewhat like the Jones Hotel in Snyder, Texas, pictured here in 1904.

				<p>Following a common theme in Texas’ history, Bolivar reached its commercial peak in the early 1880s but then began a slow decline starting in 1886 when the Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Railroad was built through Denton County. The railroad line bypassed the town by about five miles, and many of Bolivar’s people and businesses were drawn away to the new town of Sanger and other towns along the railroad. The Sartin Hotel was certainly impacted by this event, but the details of its history after the arrival of the railroad remain unknown.</p>
				
				<p>While we can never know all its secrets, the Secor Fairy sewing machine was one of many labor-saving devices patented after the Civil War. This unusual artifact reflects rapidly changing times and technologies as the industrial revolution made its way onto the Texas frontier.</p>
