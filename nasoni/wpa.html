                  <p class="text">In 1938, archeologists from the University of 
                    Texas-Works Progress Administration (WPA) project began excavation 
                    on a massive mound on the East Texas farm of Mr. and Mrs. 
                    A.J. Hatchel. The couple were accustomed to living in the 
                    looming shadow of the mound, but they were curious about its 
                    derivation&#151;it was clearly a man-made structure, its age 
                    and purpose unknown. </p>
                  <p class="text">Several years previously, pioneer Texas archeologist 
                    A.T. Jackson of UT had visited the site and conducted test 
                    excavations on the Hatchel mound. He also investigated one of the mounds atd tdhe Eli Moores site, as well as graves 
                    that had been disturbed during levee construction on the nearby 
                    Mitchell site; during the course of his work, he uncovered 
                    four more graves in the yard area of the Mitchell farm. In 
                    the next year, 21 more graves were excavated by other individuals. 
                    Other Caddo sites, such as the Foster site in Southwest Arkansas, contained mounds with numerous 
                    graves, and these locales were thought to be special cemeteries. 
                    While there had been no indications of interments in the Hatchel 
                    mound, it was nonetheless becoming clear that the Hatchel-Mitchell 
                    area held the potential to be one of the largest and most 
                    significant Caddo archeological sites in Texas. </p>
                  <p class="text">For the WPA investigators, the task was daunting, 
                    but the crews were willing and numerous at a time when jobs 
                    were scarce. Leading the fieldwork were William C. Beatty, 
                    Jr., Glenn Martin, Arthur M. Woolsey, and Alden Hayes. Initial 
                    focus was on the mound area although, during the yearlong 
                    venture, the crews excavated broad areas in the village and cemetery areas adjacent to the mound  
                    as well.</p>
                  <p class="text">As workers painstakingly excavated through the 
                    center of the mound, its complex anatomy became more apparent. 
                    At least eight superimposed occupational surfaces (labeled A-H)&#151;each 
                    showing signs of structures, other features, and occupational 
                    debris&#151;were visible as discrete layers in the deep trench 
                    profiles. These occupational surfaces were constructed atop a primary platform (labeled I and J); the mound stood 7.7 m in height and had ramps leading down to the plaza and village. As excavators continued digging, they found four 
                    graves and a pit where two bald eagles had been interred. 
                    Finally, below the mound&#151;on what was termed 
                    the &quot;pre-mound&quot; surface (labeled K)&#151;investigators found 
                    the outline of a large circular structure that had been constructed prior to ca. A.D. 1300. The mound itself began to be built around A.D. 1500 and continued in use until ca. A.D. 1691. In the months-long 
                    process, they had combed through layer after layer of history, 
                    documenting what proved to be an astonishing chronicle of 
                    the mound's creation. </p>
                  <p class="text"> Sometime before A.D. 1300, the inhabitants 
                    of a village at the Great Bend of the Red River built a least 
                    one large thatch-covered structure. How the structure was 
                    used is unknown, but we know it was built at what was then 
                    the natural ground level. After some 200 years, that structure and other remains were covered 
                    over by the erection of the first mound platform. The classic 
                    Caddo mound-building tradition&#151;with attendant pageantry 
                    and customs&#151;was in full sway. In the centuries to come, 
                    other mound-building episodes with new temple structures were to follow&#151;fully eight 
                    in all, based on the layers in the mound fill observed by 
                    investigators.</p>
                  <p class="text">Given the size of the mound&#151;about 200 feet 
                    long by 145 feet wide and eventually reaching as high as 25 
                    feet&#151;the labor involved in each construction episode must have been staggering. Basket load after basket load of dirt was carried in by the villagers until, finally, a sufficient height was reached for the community’s purposes. For the initial mound platform, this may have been about 13 feet in height. Once completed, the mound was leveled off in preparation for the next step: the erection of one or more large circular, bee-hive-shaped structures in the ca. 11-12 feet of occupation surfaces on the second mound platform. With low vertical sides, the buildings appeared to have a separate pitched roof, unlike those at other mound sites such as the Davis site. </p>
                  <p class="text">These special structures were used for an unknown 
                    period of time&#151;perhaps as the dwelling and ceremonial 
                    places of a special religious leader. Then, the evidence tells 
                    us, these structures were burned. Some speculate that the 
                    firing of the special structures marked the death of the individuals 
                    who used them, perhaps chiefs or religious leaders. But once 
                    the structures had been burned, the rebuilding process began 
                    anew, and the cycle was repeated &#151;at least seven times&#151; 
                    as structures were built, fired, mounded over, and then renewed 
                    again. Over time, the proportions of the mound reached enormous 
                    heights. The mound in the Upper Nasoni village, marked as 
                    &quot;Temple&quot; on the Teran expedition map was described 
                    by European explorers as dominating the landscape like a small 
                    hill.</p>
                  <p class="text">WPA excavators also investigated remains of several village areas of the Upper Nasoni. Adjacent to the mound, workers uncovered remains of dwellings as well as several interments that were contemporaneous with mound construction episodes; one village area has been shown by more recent work at the Hatchel site to date as early as A.D. 1040. At the nearby Mitchell site, workers found 50 graves, along with midden deposits and the possible remnants of a large structure. Although archeologists also found the graves of four individuals within the Hatchel mound fill, it was not believed to be a burial mound, but, rather, a temple mound</p>
                  <p class="text"> Archeological evidence generated by the WPA 
                    excavations showed an almost 650-year occupation at the site. 
                    An array of materials provides a glimpse of Caddo lifeways&#151;both 
                    on a day-to-day basis as well as in ceremony. Among the artifacts 
                    are artfully decorated vessels&#151;the trappings of rituals 
                    and burial offerings&#151;as well as more utilitarian pottery jars, 
                    such as those that might have been used to cook simple corn 
                    and bean stews. Ornate jewelry of bone and shell as well as 
                    ceramic pipes were found, along with the more-mundane chipped 
                    stone and pottery tools needed for hunting and farming and 
                    domestic life: arrowpoints and adzes, the milling stones used 
                    by the Caddo women to grind corn and nuts, spindle whorls 
                    and pottery smoothing pebbles, each with a simple beauty all 
                    its own.</p>
                  <p class="text">Among the pottery remains, 68 whole or partial vessels were recovered, along with more than 15,000 pottery sherds. In studying and sequencing their shapes and design motifs, archeologists have been able to develop a chronological pottery style sequence for post-A.D. 1500 Caddo periods in the local area. The full collection of artifacts and documents from the Hatchel-Mitchell-Moores complex investigations have been analyzed, including the many identified structures. </p>
                  <p class="text">The photos and maps shown here are from the 
                    1938 WPA investigations; these are housed, along with associated 
                    field notes and documents, at TARL. Only a few of the artifacts 
                    recovered are displayed here although one day we hope to add 
                    an expanded gallery of these fascinating objects, as well as 
                    additional sections on the archeology and history of the Upper 
                    Nasoni village.</p>
