<p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Deep in the west Texas desert lies a boulder-strewn canyon harboring a 
      trove of ancient art and archeological sites. Alamo Canyon lies some 100 
      kilometers (60 miles) southeast of El Paso in the vicinity of Fort Hancock, 
      near Diablo Dam on the Rio Grande. Here, generation after generation of 
      native peoples came to camp, hunt, gather and cook wild plants, and tell 
      a bit of their story through art, symbol, and ritual expression. <br>
    </p>
    <p>The significance of Alamo Canyon was first reported in the mid 1930s by 
      archeologist A. T. Jackson of the University of Texas who was collecting 
      information for a brief synopsis of rock art across Texas. In 1938, he published 
      a wide-ranging report entitled <em>Picture-Writing of Texas Indians</em> which 
      remains a highly valued resource today. Jackson reported the site as Hudspeth 
      County Site no. 11.</p>
    <p>Beginning in the early 1970s, the El Paso Archaeological Society (EPAS) 
      began a program of surveying and recording the art and archeology of the 
      area. In 1973 and 1974, EPAS members Kay Sutherland and Paul Steed each 
      led surveys of the canyon which they combined to produce a more thorough 
      report covering approximately 90% of the area. They also completed many 
      sketches of the rock art based on drawings and slides. Their illustrations 
      and a full report of their findings was published in a 1974 volume of <em>The 
      Artifact</em>, the journal published quarterly by the EPAS. Many of the 
      drawings in their report correspond to photographs of the panels previously 
      published by Jackson and help illuminate many details. A detailed description 
      of one of the most unique panels was published by Alex Apostilides in a 
      1984 volume of The Artifact. <br>
      <br>
      Although there has never been a formal excavation at Alamo Canyon, surveyors 
      have identified projectile points of the Archaic through Formative periods, 
      numerous bedrock mortar holes, middens, and a variety of pottery including 
      El Paso Brownware and Polychrome. At one location, archeologists came across 
      Casas Grandes Wares, a pottery originating in the cultural center of Paquime, 
      or Casas Grandes, hundreds of miles away in the Chihuahuan desert of northern 
      Mexico.</p>
    <p>The presence of numerous burned rock middens near rockshelters along with 
      plant grinding features, such as bedrock mortars, suggests this area was 
      used repeatedly as a camp site where people gathered and roasted wild plants. 
      Intermittent springs provided a perennial water source. Based on the predominant 
      rock art of the canyon, however, it would seem that the main attraction 
      to the area was hunting. <br>
    </p>
    <p>Beyond the seasonal availability of resources and convenient natural shelters, 
      the geologic formations of Alamo Canyon provide the perfect canvas for rock 
      art. The site lies within a formation known as the Cox sandstone which formed 
      the cliffs enclosing the canyon. Over time, this hard, rust-colored, patinated 
      sandstone weathered into large blocks. As these blocks or boulders detached 
      from the cliff face, they tumbled downslope and have littered the sides 
      of Alamo Canyon. These cliffs and boulders were an ideal media for rock 
      art, particularly petroglyphs. The brown-black patina covering the rock 
      was pecked off during the creation of the petroglyph, revealing the buff 
      color of the sandstone underneath. This contrast creates an unusual and 
      aesthetically pleasing effect which is preserved in the rock art today.</p>
    <p>Alamo Canyon contains at least 16 rock art panels&#8212;more than 500 images 
      carved (petroglyphs) or painted (pictographs) on the rocks. Spanning some 
      4,000 years of cultural history, this artwork forms one of the most extensive 
      and well-preserved rock art sites in Texas. Researchers studying these images 
      have noted that they contain particular styles and symbols prevalent in 
      other areas of the Southwest, pointing to relations and interaction between 
      various contacting cultures. </p>
    <p>Throughout the site we find images of animal figures, or zoomorphs. Most 
      of these images appear to represent big-horned game such as deer and mountain 
      sheep. Figures of bear and desert bighorn sheep, two species that only existed 
      here prehistorically, also are depicted in the artwork. Interestingly, no 
      animal appears in isolation on these walls. Some researchers believe this 
      indicates that these different animals were hunted during the same time 
      period. According to these depictions, Alamo Canyon harbored large game 
      of several varieties. It is interesting to note that there are no images 
      of small game such as rabbits or squirrels. The absence of such smaller, 
      more readily available prey may indicate that food and hunting were not 
      the focus of the artists, but perhaps a ritual or spiritual message was 
      intended. <br>
      <br>
      Alamo Canyon artists created images of their weapons as well, providing 
      archeologists with a relative dating framework for the art. Rock art has 
      proved difficult to date using conventional radiocarbon assays. At Alamo 
      Canyon, however, archeologists recognized the distinctive morphological 
      characteristics of the projectile points known as Shumla, a Late Archaic 
      stemmed dart point with deep basal notches and long, downturned tangs. <br>
      <br>
      At least 124 renderings of Shumla dart points were carved into the boulders 
      and walls of Alamo Canyon. This point type has been identified at a variety 
      of sites within 100 miles of Alamo Canyon. Many of these sites contain rockart 
      that depicts hunting scenes in large panels that sometimes cover entire 
      boulders or cliff sides. At Alamo Canyon, there are several panels with 
      hunting scenes featuring figures of spears, men, and animals. Although many 
      archeologists date Shumla points to approximately 2500 B.C. to A.D. 200, 
      others believe they may have been in use several thousand years earlier.<br>
      <br>
      One particular figure stands out from the hunting panels. It is an image 
      of a horned human or what could be considered a shaman. Images of horned 
      humans have also been found in the Glen Canyon Area, a petroglyph site in 
      northern Chihuahua, and nearby <a href="../../hueco/index.html" target="_blank">Hueco Tanks</a>. This suggests 
      a migration of this cultural style or transfer of it through contact and 
      trade relationships. <br>
      <br>
      There is another artistic style found at Alamo Canyon which also suggests 
      the diffusion or contact of cultures. Looking east from the images of spears 
      and hunting parties, one sees panels or walls featuring figures of plumed 
      serpents, humans with pronounced leg muscles and arms in implied motion, 
      humans appearing to be carrying burdens, masks and faces with abstract decorations, 
      feathers, outlined forms, cloud terraces, and abundant geometric designs. 
      In one particular location named Jaguar Cave, there is an image of what 
      some researchers have termed a &quot;deer Kachina Man.&quot;</p>
    <p>All of these images are characteristic of the Mesoamerican culture of Casas 
      Grandes in northwestern Chihuahua, which influenced the Katchina Cult and 
      Pueblo Pantheon. The influence of Casas Grandes spread throughout the Mimbres 
      and Jornada Mogollon regions of the Southwest, and the motifs found at Alamo 
      Canyon may be associated with this particular cultural diffusion. Archeological 
      evidence of trade and contact between the peoples of Casas Grandes and Alamo 
      Canyon was found in Jaguar Cave in the form of Casas Grandes wares. <br>
      <br>
      There is also rock art at Alamo Canyon which dates to a much later time 
      period. It has been associated with the Sumas, Jocomes, and Mescalero Apaches 
      who occupied the region at the time of their first encounters with the Spanish 
      in the late 1500s. <br>
      <br>
      Excavations at Alamo Canyon might provide information about the people who 
      inhabited this area and carved the fascinating images in the rock. At present, 
      most of the information we have about the history of Alamo Canyon comes 
      from the petroglyphs themselves. Enigmatic and provacative, the rock art 
      offers stories waiting to be interpreted and made more meaningful. </p>

According to Apostolides, an Apache informant suggested that the woman is a “storyteller”.  The position of a storyteller in many Indian tribes is of great importance because they retain all of the knowledge of the tribe’s past.
