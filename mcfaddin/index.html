  <tr>
    <td width="480" valign="top"><p align="left">McFaddin Beach is a 32-kilometer long stretch of sandy beach in  Jefferson County  on the upper Texas Gulf coast, extending from High  Island on the west to Sea Rim   State Park on the east. Sabine Pass  and the Louisiana  state line lie another 19 km farther to the east. Although this public beachfront  parcel has been assigned a trinomial archeological site designation (41 JF 50),  it is not really an archeological site, but rather a place where artifacts and  animal bones have been washing ashore for many years. Archeologists use the terms <em>redeposited</em> or <em>secondary context</em> to refer to  accumulations like this. </p>
      <p align="left">The Texas coastline is a  dynamic environment where sand can either be added or subtracted by currents  and storm surges, and McFaddin   Beach is a place where  net erosion of sand has been taking place, flanked on either side by areas of  net accretion. Despite this, it is clear that the artifacts are washing ashore  from the Gulf, not eroding out from deposits behind the beach. A few of the  artifacts have marine organisms (barnacles or bryozoa) attached. Backhoe  testing (in 1983 and 2004) on both sides of Highway 87 has shown that the  Pleistocene Beaumont Formation lies less than 2 meters below the ground  surface, overlain by sterile Holocene sand and clay representing swamp and  marsh deposits. Radiocarbon and OSL (optically stimulated luminescence) dates  on the Beaumont/Prairie Formation range from roughly 28,000 to about 135,000  calendar years B.P. or more.</p>
      <p align="left"> Although artifacts from essentially the entire known span of  Texas  prehistory are represented, the most striking aspect of this place are the  extraordinary numbers of Paleoindian and Early Archaic&nbsp; projectile points that have been discovered  here. McFaddin Beach  alone has produced more Clovis points than any single county in the state of Texas &mdash; over a hundred  of them. Its nearest competitor, Gaines  County in west Texas,  has less than a third as many known Clovis  points. Even the Gault site in central Texas  has produced less than half as many Clovis points,  despite years of intensive excavation. As a result, McFaddin Beach  shows up as a conspicuous hot spot on both state and national distribution maps  of Paleoindian points.</p>
     <p align="left"> This peculiar concentration of material inevitably leads to  several questions:</p>
  <li>
     does the high density of projectile points correspond to  an actual concentration of people (for example, a tight cluster of major base  camps), a Paleoindian population density unparalleled elsewhere in the state?
  </li>
<li>
   or are coastal processes simply concentrating artifacts from  a much larger area of the seafloor, giving a misleading impression of true  artifact density?
</li>
  <li>
     or are the large numbers of artifacts simply a result of  consistently intense scrutiny by beachcombers over the past several decades?
  </li>
  <li>
     what was the attraction for early human populations in  this particular part of the coastal plain?
  </li>
<li>
   and are the fossil bones related in some way to the  Paleoindian occupations, or are they much older?
</li> </p>
 
     <p align="left"> To address these questions, we must understand something about  how the site has come to light, the geologic history of the Gulf coast and its  salt domes, and the postglacial history of falling and rising sea level.</p>
      <h3 align="left">History of  Investigation
        <a name="history"></a></h3>
      <p align="left">Some of the earliest collections from the beach were made by  local residents Odis and Beverly Beckham, especially after Hurricane Carla in  1961. Dr. Russell J. Long, a biology professor at Lamar University,  contacted local collectors, studied their collections, and published the first  summary of the site in 1977, a short report issued by the Spindletop Museum.  Two years earlier, Jeffrey Russell, a student of Long&rsquo;s, completed an inventory  and study of the fossil vertebrates in the beach collections as a Master&rsquo;s  thesis at Lamar University; it remains the major source of  information on the fossils. In the early 1980s, the establishment of the  Strategic Petroleum Reserve facility at the Big Hill salt dome (inland from McFaddin Beach) led to construction of a brine  disposal pipeline across the marsh, the beach, and out into the Gulf. Survey  and backhoe trenching (1982-83) by Coastal Environments, Inc., in advance of  this pipeline provided the first formal investigation of the geology  immediately inland from the beach, and showed that the artifacts were not  coming from this area. In 1983, avocational archeologist Paul Tanner of Port Arthur began keeping  detailed locational records of artifacts found on the beach, and over time  became the chief field researcher for the site. At about the same time, the  Minerals Management Service in the US Department of the Interior became  concerned about the possible impact of petroleum exploration and recovery on  submerged archeological sites on the continental shelf, and commissioned some  studies of the seafloor geology. These did not include the McFaddin Beach  area, but they greatly add to our knowledge of the undersea geology. A 1986  study by Charles Pearson and others from Coastal Environments reconstructs the  submergence history of the drowned Sabine River valley south of McFaddin Beach.</p>
      <p align="left"><br>
        In 1991, a conference on the site was organized in Port Arthur by Dee Ann  Story, Paul Tanner, and Ellen Sue Turner, and 27 local collections were brought  for examination, photography, and preliminary documentation. These included  both artifacts and vertebrate fossils. In 1992, the Bureau of Economic Geology  (UT Austin) sank a series of geologic cores along the coast, including three on  or just offshore from McFaddin   Beach. In 1994-96, Melanie  Stright, an archeologist with the Minerals Management Service (US Dept. of the  Interior), began a detailed study of five of the best-documented collections,  the ones with recorded dates and locations for the finds. Her study included  880 artifacts, or about a third of the total known from the site at the time. She  examined sources of toolstone, degree of wear, resharpening, the spatial  position of the artifact along the beach, ages of the artifacts based on  typology, and functional classes of artifacts. Completed as a Ph.D. dissertation  at American University, her study was published in  1999 by the Minerals Management Service and remains the chief source of  information on the site. In 2004, David Driver of Moore Archeological  Consulting carried out a survey of a proposed wetlands area at McFaddin  National Wildlife Refuge and excavated five backhoe trenches (1.0-1.7 m deep)  on the inland side of the highway, finding no cultural material. Since the 1991  conference, Paul Tanner has continued monitoring the site and has recorded,  among other things, several more Clovis points  from the beach. </p>

  <tr>
    <td width="440" valign="top"><p align="left">It seems clear that artifacts and fossils are arriving on  the beach from a submerged, offshore source area, perhaps at no great distance  or depth in the Gulf. It is also clear that both the present beach area and the  offshore source were actually high and dry parts of the inland coastal zone  until relatively recently in geologic history. This was an interfluvial area  between the Trinity River valley to the southwest and the Sabine   River valley to the northeast. During the Pleistocene, or last ice  age, so much water was sequestered in major continental ice sheets (like the  Laurentide ice sheet in North America) and in alpine ice sheets rimming the  earth&rsquo;s mountain ranges, that global sea level was drastically lowered. </p>
      <p align="left">Some of  the latest and most interesting research on sea level history comes from&nbsp; Barbados,  on the western edge of the North Atlantic, and  it is based on isotopically dated samples of four species of drowned corals,  one of which is known to grow at a restricted depth range. Uranium-thorium  dating is used to fix the ages of coral reefs that were killed by postglacial  sea level rise. These new studies suggest that maximum glaciation (and  consequently, minimum sea levels) occurred about 26,000 calendar years ago,  with sea level about 125 meters lower than at present. This is about 5000 years  earlier and five meters deeper than the consensus values that most geologists  have customarily used (21,000 calendar years, or 18,000 radiocarbon years for  the Last Glacial Maximum, and a 120 m lowering). At 26,000 B.P., the Gulf  shoreline in the upper Texas  coast region would have been perhaps 200 km to the southeast of its present  position. It should also be noted that this is just the latest lowering of Gulf  sea level during the Pleistocene &mdash; there were earlier highstands and lowstands.</p>
      <p align="left">
      By 14,000 years ago, sea level was rising rapidly because of  ice sheet melting. Assessing the rate of rise in the Gulf is complicated by the  fact that eustatic sea level indicators in the Gulf of Mexico tend to plot  higher than contemporaneous indicators elsewhere in the world (for discussion,  see the reference by Simms and others in &ldquo;Sources&rdquo;). The oldest radiocarbon  dated shell or peat samples cored from the northern Gulf are about 19,700  calendar years old. If we rely on the Barbados coral data, by about  13,300-13,500 calendar years B.P. (when the archeological record at McFaddin  Beach begins with the deposition of Clovis points at the source area) sea level  still stood about 65-68 m below the present level, the shoreline was still 175  km away, and the site area still well inland. </p>
    <p align="left">
      At about 10,000 calendar years B.P., when various types of  Late Paleoindian projectile points were being deposited at the site, sea level  had risen to 20 meters below the present level. At about 7700 cal B.P., a barrier  shoreline developed about 55 km southeast of the McFaddin area. The rate of sea  level rise (and flooding of the continental shelf) was especially rapid in the  early Holocene from about 9000 to 7000 cal B.P. Without knowing where the actual  source area for the McFaddin artifacts is located, it is impossible to say  exactly when the area was flooded and rendered inaccessible for habitation, but  there are some artifacts from the beach that Stright classifies as  &ldquo;transitional Archaic&rdquo; (about 2350-1250 cal B.P.) and Late Prehistoric (about  1250-400 cal B.P.). By the time these were discarded, the source area may well  have been flooded, which raises the possibility that these most recent artifacts  might have been discarded on the beach, rather than washing ashore like the  earlier material.</p>
    <p align="left">
      During the period of lowered sea level, the combined  channels of the Sabine River and Calcasieu  River incised the exposed continental  shelf, running southwestward roughly parallel to the present coast and about 30  km out from it, joining the Trinity River  channel, then turning southward. The Deweyville terrace system that flanks  these rivers continues onto the continental shelf, running under the waters of  the Gulf. As sea level rose, the river valley was flooded, with the contact  between fresh and sea water turned into an estuary. Marine coring in the 1980s  by archeologists penetrated a <em>Rangia</em> shell deposit and a bone concentration with burned and unburned bone (water  snake, amphibian, fish), fish scales, seeds, and nutshell. These may be bayside  archeological sites occupied as the Gulf waters flooded what had been an  estuary. A radiocarbon assay of 8055 &plusmn; 90 radiocarbon years B.P. on some of the  shell equates to about 8500 cal B.P. (marine database, using standard marine  reservoir age). Estuarine deposits dating from 7400 to 7400 cal B.P. (buried  under Sabine Bank) and 8400 to 7700 cal B.P. (buried under Heald Bank) have been  cored offshore. At 7700 cal B.P., the shoreline was still some 50 km away; by  5300 B.P., it had approached to about 40 km away; and by 2800 cal B.P., was about 5  km away from McFaddin   Beach. By 1500 cal B.P. (or  about 450 A.D.), the shoreline was approximately in its present position. Two  lines of vibracores punched across the valley axis contain pine, oak, juniper,  cypress, grass, sedge, and other&nbsp; pollen  types suggesting vegetation similar to that found on the coastal plain today.</p>
    <p align="left">
      What happened after the middle Holocene, or about 6000 cal  B.P., is in dispute. &nbsp;One group of  geologists insists there has been a fluctuating series of late Holocene <em>highstands</em> &mdash; periods during which sea  level actually stood higher than today and covered part of what is now dry  (well, dry to marshy, perhaps) land, evidenced by a series of inland beach  ridges radiocarbon dated to that period. Another group of geologists insists  that the beach ridges are really storm surge deposits, and document Late  Holocene climatic intervals with increased storminess. They maintain that sea  level has risen more or less smoothly to its present level and has never  onlapped the land during the Holocene.</p>
    <p align="left"><br>
      When glaciation initially lowered sea level, the exposed  continental shelf would have been contaminated with salt, but rainfall and  runoff would have flushed the salt back into the Gulf long before human  populations arrived. This broad, exposed plain (at least 175 km wide) might  have been covered with grassland interfingered with gallery forests developed  on the Deweyville terrace systems lining the river valleys. The poorly dated  vertebrate fossil faunas from the region include various grazing animals like  mammoth, bison, horse, and pronghorn. Lowered sea level also led to greatly  increased groundwater flow from the continental interior to the shelf by  removing hydrostatic pressure. According to one estimate, in glacial periods  every 50 km of coastline received an extra 40 cubic kilometers of fresh water  annually due to this effect (see the reference by Faure and others). Clusters  of occupation sites may have formed around springs on the exposed shelf.</p>
    <p align="left"><br>
      The McFaddin Beach Salt Dome, located about 1.6 km offshore  and buried under about 400 meters of Pleistocene and Holocene sediments, may be  relevant to the geologic history of the site. Although the salt itself is  Jurassic in age, many of the salt diapirs in the Gulf have been active during  the Holocene. If the McFaddin   Beach dome has  experienced active upward movement during the Holocene, it may have resulted in  some uplift of the seafloor sediments, possibly exposing archeological deposits  to erosion by storm surges. Joints and faults may also be associated with  diapir growth as well, and salt domes are often associated with saline springs.  If there were saline springs associated in some way with this deeply buried  salt during the period of lowered sea level, the springs might have been  attractive as a salt lick for a variety of vertebrate species.</p>
    <h3 align="left">Vertebrate Fossils      <a name="vert"></a></h3>
      <p align="left">
      The vertebrate fauna found on the beach is similar to other  poorly-dated Rancholabrean faunas of southeast Texas and adjacent Louisiana  (the Rancholabrean is the most recent of the Pleistocene land mammal ages,  beginning at least 300,000 years ago), such as the Damon Mound, Texas City  Dike, Avery Island, and Sims Bayou faunas. A fragment of proboscidean tusk from  McFaddin Beach was assayed at 11,100&plusmn;750  radiocarbon years before present (the 13C value is -24.3 &permil;) by the  Gulf Oil Corporation, but the assay was done over 30 years ago, and it is not  clear if the material dated was the collagen fraction, or the collagen plus  apatite. This assay equates to about 12,000-13,850 calendar years ago. Many of  the fossils are mineralized or stained by organic or mineral deposits.</p>
      <p align="left"><br>
        Although this assay is squarely in the middle of the Clovis  time span, it would be a mistake to assume all the McFaddin fauna is of Clovis age. It would not be at all surprising if a much  better dating program were to reveal that the beach fossils vary widely in age,  with many of them much older than Clovis material, and a few much more recent.  The list includes several extinct species: sabertooth cat, cave bear, ground  sloth, pampathere (giant armadillo), mammoth, mastodon, peccary, llama, tapir,  and extinct horse. Some of these (<em>Holmesina,  Smilodon</em>, <em>Tremarctos, </em><em>Neochoerus</em>, <em>Eremotherium</em>, <em>Mylohyus</em>)  are suspected to have become extinct well before the Clovis  time span. Two mammoth teeth with possible human modification, some abraded or  chipped long bone fragments from unknown species, and a bone projectile point  have been found on the beach.</p>
      <p align="left">
      The McFaddin   Beach fauna is clearly  not an unbiased vertebrate sample, because the only small mammals present are a  cotton rat and a prairie dog. Fossil bones from small animals like rodents have  probably been overlooked by beachcombers. But it is interesting to note that  aquatic animals make up a significant part of the list: gar, catfish, sunfish,  various turtles, alligator, otter, beaver, raccoon, capybara, and tapir all  live in or near freshwater habitats. According to Paul Tanner, fossil turtle shell,  horse bones, and deer antler are most common. Man of the terrestrial species  (prairie dog, cotton rat, cottontail, bison, horse, peccary, pampathere) were  either grazers or rooters, living in open grassy or brushy habitats rather than  woodland. A few others&nbsp; come from wooded  (mastodon, ground sloth) or woodland gap (tapir) habitats, and these may be  from gallery woodlands that lined streams crossing the exposed continental  shelf.</p>
      <p align="left">There are perhaps two different models to explain the origin  of the beach fauna. Damon Mound, a Brazoria   County salt dome,  furnishes an example. At Damon Mound the sediments overlying the salt diapir  are thought to be point bar and levee deposits of Beaumont age. The fauna is very similar to  the McFaddin fauna, and the bones probably belong to animals that lived and  died in the ancestral Brazos or San   Bernard River  valleys, either in the immediate vicinity or having been redeposited downstream  by flooding. Upward diapir growth during the Pleistocene and Holocene has  pushed the overlying alluvial sediments upward into a prominent mound, exposing  them to erosion and quarrying activities. If this model applies also to the  McFaddin dome (which is buried under the seafloor, unlike Damon Mound), it  could indicate that most of the McFaddin bones predate and are unrelated to  human occupation.</p>
      <p align="left">
      The second model is more speculative because so little is  known about the McFaddin dome. If joints or faults allowed saline springs to  develop some 400 meters above the McFaddin dome while the continental shelf was  exposed, they might have been attractive to a variety of herbivores. Many  herbivores resort to salt licks (both wet and dry) and resort to geophagy  (earth eating) to obtain supplemental elements (such as sodium, magnesium, iodine,  and carbonates) during some seasons. This often happens during the transition  from low-quality winter forage to rapidly greening spring vegetation, and it is  especially important to females who have to meet the demands of lactation,  growth, and weight regain during the spring season. Forage, especially early  spring forage, may contain toxins (these are plant defense strategies to ward  off grazers) or high levels of acidity. Clay consumption may help to buffer  rumen acidity and neutralize secondary plant compounds such as tannins and  alkaloids. In Kenya,  licks frequented by African elephants contain measurably higher levels of  sodium and iodine in the clay that is eaten. </p>
      <p align="left">
      Some researchers have also suggested that licks serve a  social function, as a &ldquo;meetup place&rdquo; for gregarious herbivores. In British Columbia, as  Ayotte and others have noted, &ldquo;wet licks are associated with groundwater  springs, often becoming treeless areas of deep mud after years of use by moose  and elk.&rdquo; The resemblance to some of the mammoth kill sites at cienegas in the  western US or the Quaternary bone deposits at Saltville, Virginia, &nbsp;is striking, and it could well be that salt  licks on the coastal plain attracted not only mammoths, bison, and horses, but  also Paleoindian hunters, who probably would have been thoroughly familiar with  the congregation times and gender composition of herds. A Master&rsquo;s thesis study  by Laura Abraczinskas of the spatial association between salines and  proboscidean finds in Michigan  was inconclusive, in part because of incomplete documentation of some of the  sites. All of this is simply speculative, however, until we know more about the  geology of McFaddin Dome.</p>

      Although Melanie Stright studied only the five  best-documented collections, compared to the 27 that were examined at the 1991  conference, her research remains the chief source of information on the  artifact assemblage. When looking at time-diagnostic artifacts (mostly  projectile points, but also including such things as Clovis blades and beveled  knives), the most striking aspect of the assemblage is the large proportion of  Paleoindian artifacts &mdash; probably about 45% of the time-diagnostic items. Late  Archaic artifacts (defined here as after about 2800 cal B.P. and before the Late  Prehistoric) probably account for almost 32%. Early and Middle Archaic  artifacts are much less well represented, although it must be admitted that  very little is known about this span of time in East and Southeast Texas. Stright&rsquo;s  study sample included 53 San Patrice, 36 Scottsbluff, 27 Dalton, 21 Clovis, 13  Plainview, 13, Pelican, 3 Hell Gap, 2 Folsom, 2 Angostura, and several other Paleoindian  types. Are Stright&rsquo;s five collections representative of the entire beach  assemblage? We can probably assume they are, although we should remember that  there are now five times as many Clovis points  documented as in her study sample. Presumably the proportional representation  of different time periods would remain about the same if we could inventory  every artifact found at the beach.</p>
	  <p align="left">
      For most sites in Texas  with long occupational histories, it is usually the case that post-Paleoindian  material vastly outnumbers the Paleoindian collections. The usual explanations  are that early populations were highly mobile and thinly scattered, not  burdened with much material culture, and that early components have had a much  longer time to suffer the vicissitudes of site destruction. A collection where  Paleoindian material dominates is highly unusual. It is also clear that in  Stright&rsquo;s study sample, the earliest Paleoindian types (Clovis, Folsom,  Midland) are less numerous than somewhat later Paleoindian types like  Scottsbluff, Angostura, and Early Side-Notched, and much of the Paleoindian  material consists of eastern woodland artifact types such as Dalton, San  Patrice, and Pelican. According to archeologist Dennis Stanford, many of the Clovis points resemble eastern rather than western  manufacturing styles.</p>
	  <p align="left"><br>
	    Even more so than the rest of the Texas  coast, McFaddin Beach lies in a region where knappable  stone of any size is very scarce. The nearest bedrock sources are about 160 km  away. Aside from these, petrified wood, fossil palm wood, and Citronelle  gravels in Louisiana  are some of the nearest sources. The nearest rivers, the Sabine and Neches, do  not cross the Edwards   Plateau and carry no  Edwards chert&nbsp; in terrace gravels. In  1995, geoarcheologist and lithic sourcing expert Larry Banks examined the five  collections analyzed by Stright, to document the original source areas of the  rocks used to make the artifacts (764 artifacts were examined). Using his  extensive personal reference collection of rock types, Banks discovered some of  the most interesting data about the site yet to emerge. Banks found that  Edwards chert and quartzitic chert accounted for almost 72% of the total; about  65% of&nbsp; this lacked visual evidence of  gravel origins. The nearest Edwards bedrock outcrops are about 274 km away,  while Edwards gravels occurs in terraces flanking the major rivers from the Brazos southward. Artifacts made from gravels could be  identified by the presence of cobble cortex or circular weathering bands, but  Banks suggests many artifacts could be made from gravel cherts without any  remaining visual clues to their origin. The next most abundant sources were  petrified wood or fossil palm wood, and Tecovas jasper from the Texas panhandle.  Curiously, although Tecovas jasper is well-represented, Alibates silicified  dolomite seems to be absent. Ouachita Mountain sources represent 16 items, Fisher Quartzite  9, the Arbuckle Mountains 6, and the Ozark Mountains  5.</p>
	  <p align="left"><br>
	    The biggest surprise, however, is the wide variety and  immense geographic area from which the rock types are drawn. Banks identified  59 different named sources, plus unidentified gravels, Ogalalla quartzite (widespread  over the entire southern Plains), petrified wood, &nbsp;and palm wood. There are Plainview points of  Minnelusa/Casper/Madera chert (Wyoming), Weeping Water Creek chert (Nebraska),  and possibly from Pinetop (Ouachita Mountains) or St. Joe (Ozark Mountains)  sources; a Dalton point of Weeping Water Creek chert; a Clovis point and a  drill made on a small Scottsbluff point, of Knife River chert; and a scraper  possibly made of Chuska (New Mexico) chert. The most distant sources are almost  entirely represented by Paleoindian artifacts. Found by Jean Lane, but not included in Banks&rsquo;s  study is an unidentified fragmentary projectile point made of obsidian. Thomas R. Hester submitted the point to  the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory for analysis using Precise X-Ray Fluorescence, and the source was identified as  Zacualtipan, Hidalgo,  over 1000 km to the south</p>
	  <p align="left">
      Also unexpected is the fact that many of the projectile  point types with eastern affiliations are made of Edwards chert, either from  far-distant outcrops or from moderately distant gravel sources (terrace gravels  of the Guadalupe, Colorado, or even Colorado and Brazos rivers, perhaps). Many,  perhaps most, of the San Patrice and Pelican points, and other types such as  Big Sandy, Dalton, Motley, Epps, Gary, and Delhi-like are  made of Edwards chert. It is clear that much of the lithic industry, not only  in Paleoindian but also in later times, was supported by raw materials drawn  from far away and from a diverse geographic supply area. Is this typical of  sites in the region, or is it unique to McFaddin Beach?  We should remember that comprehensive sourcing studies like this one by Larry  Banks are quite rare. In most cases where lithic sources are pursued, studies  focus on a single exotic artifact, or at least a small sample. Studies of very  large samples like the five McFaddin Beach collections are rare, especially in stone-poor  regions of east Texas  and the eastern US. If we had more such studies, we might find that toolstone  movement across the landscape was much more extensive than expected in  post-Paleoindian times.</p>

    <td width="480"><p align="left">As a major focus of her dissertation, Melanie Stright  studied the spatial distribution of artifacts on the beach to look for clues to  the possible location and nature of sites offshore. Using plottings supplied by  the five collectors who contributed data, she compiled a composite map of  artifact locations. By measuring GPS coordinates on landmarks used by the  collectors, she was able to compute UTM (Universal Transverse Mercator)  coordinates for each artifact. Importing the data into a GIS (Geographic Information  Systems) program allowed her to look for clustering of artifacts by age, date  of collection, artifact weight, and other variables. Clustering of artifacts  could indicate 1) environmental processes that redistribute artifacts  systematically, 2) remnant patterning that hints at locations of sites  offshore, or 3) systematic collector bias.</p>
      <p align="left">When all the artifacts in the beach were plotted together, a  major cluster of artifacts along the eastern half of the beach and a less  prominent cluster along the western half appeared, with an area (&ldquo;the gap&rdquo; at  the center where only seven artifacts were found. Is this area less productive  because the beach is a bit steeper here, or because this area is less  accessible to collectors?</p>
      <p align="left"> Artifacts are believed to come ashore as a result of seafloor  erosion associated with major storm surges. Stright found that 11 major  tropical storms occurred between 1970 and 1989, plus another in 1995, the years  that her study collections had been acquired. During the spring and summer  months, from April to September, a strong longshore current sweeps  southwestward along the coast, a current that would tend to pick up any  artifacts brought into shallow water by storm surges, and redistribute them  toward the Bolivar   Peninsula. During the  winter months, from October to March, a weaker current sweeps in the opposite  direction and would probably have much less effect. In support of this pattern,  Stright noted that artifacts from the western cluster tended to be more heavily  worn. Anyone who has been swimming or surfcasting at places like Galveston or Padre Island along the Texas coast knows how strong this longshore  current can be. Swimmers and fishing weights usually come ashore some distance  from where they started out.</p>
      <p align="left">Human disturbance might be another possible source of  artifact movement. Paul Tanner noted an unusually large number of artifacts  along the western portion of the beach after the winter of 1983, after  construction of the Big Hill brine disposal pipeline. While examining artifacts  at the 1991 conference, archeologist Mike Collins noted that most of the older  artifacts (particularly Clovis points) showed little evidence of wear, while  many of the younger, Archaic artifacts showed abrasion from rolling in the surf  and chemical pitting from exposure to seawater. He suspected that this might be  evidence of scouring of stratified sites, with the younger artifacts having  been exhumed several years ago, and with and older and more deeply buried  Paleoindian artifacts just now beginning to be exposed by scouring. Paul Tanner  has also made the same observation.</p>
      <p align="left">In addition to studying visual plots of artifacts on maps of  the beach, Stright also did a nearest-neighbor analysis of artifact locations.  Nearest neighbor is a statistical test used in geography, wildlife biology, and  botany to look for clustering of discrete objects. The distance between each  pair of objects is computed and compared to a sample consisting of the same  number of randomly located objects. The distribution can be clustered, random,  or regular. Stright found that the data set as a whole was clustered, and  likewise the Paleoindian artifacts were clustered &mdash; perhaps just representing  the two major clusters at each end of the beach &mdash; but all other subgroups (such  as Late Archaic or Early Archaic) had &ldquo;regular&rdquo; distributions. These results  are perhaps more a result of the nearly one-dimensional sampling area and the  smaller numbers of the post-Paleoindian artifacts than anything else. The beach  is, after all, 32 kilometers long but only 25 meters wide.</p>
      <h3 align="left">Lessons Learned
        <a name="lessons"></a></h3>
      <p align="left">  McFaddin Beach  is a textbook case for the importance of <em>provenience</em> and <em>context</em> in archeology. If we  could actually see the areas of seafloor where the artifacts and fossils are coming  from, we would know if any of the vertebrate fossils are associated with Clovis artifacts. Are any of these the remains of  Clovis-aged megafaunal kills, or are they much older fossils scoured from some  other location and brought by chance to the same stretch of beachfront? Are the  Paleoindian artifacts coming from one or a few large campsites with prolonged  occupations (something like the Gault site in central Texas) or from a much larger number of  smaller, more widely scattered sites? Are the sites stratified, or are the  Paleoindian and Archaic artifacts arriving from entirely different places on  the submerged landscape? Why is there so little chipping debris in the  collections? Is it because flakes, blades and flake fragments are too hard to  see on the beach, or less interesting to collectors, or is it simply because  toolstone was scarce and most reduction was done closer to the rock source? Why  is there so little evidence of Clovis blades?  Is the McFaddin Beach salt dome in any way relevant to  the archeology or the artifact distribution? We would probably have answers to  all these questions and more if we could actually see the submerged sites  themselves, but that will have to wait for better underwater exploration  technology. For now, all the really important questions remain unanswered  because of the lack of provenience and context. We should also point out that  because many of the beach collectors allowed their collections to be studied by  archeologists, and some of them even kept map records of their finds, we  nevertheless know a lot more than we would otherwise.</p>

The McFaddin   Beach exhibit was written  by archeologist <strong>Kenneth (Ken) M. Brown</strong>. Susan Dial  and Heather Smith developed the exhibit. </p>
      <p align="left">Brown&rsquo;s  interest in archeology can be traced back to his teen years participating in  Texas Archeological Society field schools, and he has been at it ever since. Awarded a &nbsp;Ph.D. from the University of Texas  at Austin, he has worked in the field for nearly 40 years. Ken's dissertation on the <a href="../st-plains/images/ap5.html" target="_blank">Berger Bluff </a>site provides unique insight into the Late Pleistocene and Early Holocene climatic history of the coastal plains of Texas. A Research Fellow at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory,  Brown has pursued interests in paleoenvironmental analysis and the study of wooden  artifacts. For this exhibit, he drew on the sources listed below as well as   information gathered during visits to the McFaddin   Beach site and  examination of various artifact collections.</p>
