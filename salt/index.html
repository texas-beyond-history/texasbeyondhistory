					<p>Geologic salt sources punctuate the North American landscape, as crystalizing crusts on ephemeral desert lakes, as domes of rock salt deforming and rising between harder rock formations below the earth’s surface, and as saline mineral springs. Oceans are salty primarily because of runoff from land, though submarine vents and volcanism also contribute salts. Salt is the only so-called rock we savor daily, and it has been an important resource for people throughout time. Essential for human life, salt is also much more than a dietary supplement – it is used as a critical chemical in industrial and preindustrial societies alike, and it is ascribed supernatural powers in many cultures. </p>
					
					<p>Pure mineral salt is made up of equal amounts of sodium and chloride (NaCl). The geology of each unique salt deposit imparts distinct minerology, expressed through color, texture, and flavor, as well as chemical composition. Think of the chunky pink rock salt from the Himalayas, flakey grey sea salt from France, and volcanic Hawaiian red and Indian black salts. The natural mineral composition and texture of salt can be, and when sold commercially usually is, altered through processing to derive a product closer to pure NaCl.  </p>

					<p>Salt is used in industry, as a food supplement, for food preservation and fermentation, and in medicine. Salt was used historically as a chemical component in dying fabric, tanning hides, making soap, and processing silver ore, among countless other processes. Today, the vast majority of salt produced is used in industry. Familiar household uses for salt include salting bathwater to ease a variety of ailments, using saline to flush clogged sinuses, and adding to the ice in old fashioned ice cream makers to lower the freezing temperature (this effect of salt on ice is why it is applied to icy roads as well). Perhaps less well known is that salt has a place in mythologies and spiritual belief systems around the world. </p>

				  <p>Salt making, the process of extracting and refining salt, follows similar processes wherever it is made - be it in Mayan Mesoamerica, Ghana, eastern Europe, or Texas. Salt making is usually done through mining or reduction of brine (salt water). Archeologists are presented with a challenge when seeking to identify salt’s signature in the ancient past; its proclivity to dissolution makes the mineral all but invisible in the archeological record, except in very rare cases, requiring the archeologist to look for other clues to salt’s use and significance. </p>

				  <p>In Texas, historical documents and accounts evidence a long history of salt procurement, much of it centered on the politics of access and control. Such salt sites include La Sal del Rey in south Texas, the Great Salt Lake in Willacy County, and the San Andres Salt Trail and Guadalupe Salt Flats (Salt Basin) near El Paso, all of which were harvested during the Spanish Texas and Mexican Texas periods. During the Civil War, the Ledbetter Salt Work and Palestine Salt Works were among many Texas salt works providing salt to the Confederacy for use in tanning hides, preserving meat, feeding livestock, and for the table. There were many other salt making enterprises in Texas, from Corpus Christi’s Old Salt Mill to Grande Saline in northeast Texas, one of one of Morton Salt’s saline sources.</p>
					
				  <p>In comparison to the historic record, little is recorded about how the indigenous people of Texas obtained, processed, and used salt. The archeology, ethnography, and iconography from other regions, such as the greater American Southwest, Mesoamerica, and the Eastern Woodlands (the western extent of which includes East Texas), provide a framework for identifying salt gathering and making sites (salt works) in Texas. This exhibit introduces aboriginal salt use in Texas through the archeology of two vastly different salt sources –  Salt Basin, a playa salt flat on the west side of Guadalupe Peak in the northern Chihuahuan Desert that people returned to for millennia, and a circa AD 1300-1700 Caddo salt making site in northeast Texas’ Pineywoods.</p>

					<h3 id="section-one">Biological Importance </h3>
					
				  <p>Our biological need for salt is its most universal human importance. Sodium and chloride operate at the body’s cellular level to regulate functions including hydration, blood pressure, the nervous system, and contractions of our muscles and heart. Without salt, we die. Today, most salt in our bodies comes from foods seasoned with salt. However, salt is found naturally in some foods, notably meat. Many archeologists believe the need for supplementary salt in the diet of people coincided with the adoption of agriculture; as North American people began to eat more crop plants such as maize, and less meat, they may have added salt to their foods to meet their biological requirement. </p>

Salt depleted in body by labor; excess intake advised.'' The WPA, Works Progress Administration, was a federal agency tasked with providing jobs to the unemployed during the Great Depression.

				  <p>Other archeologists disagree on this hypothesis, with divergent perspectives. Some point to evidence that Paleoindian people visited salt sources as well, suggesting that salt was important prior to the advent of agriculture. Early Americans may have followed game to the salt licks (salines) where the animals drank salty mineral water or licked salt-saturated soils to fulfill their desires for salt. It has been hypothesized that important ancient trails were established by these salt-seeking game and the hunters who pursued them. On the other hand, some archeologists believe that salt procurement and salt making was not an important aspect of most indigenous North Americans’ lives until after European contact, well after the development of agriculture in North America, pointing out that major salt works were not common until after contact. Historic period salt making was driven by a need for salt for hide tanning, an important trade commodity, as well other industries. </p>

				  <p>The average American overconsumes salt, eating about 3,400 mg per day. The fact that some groups of indigenous people have survived on much less salt begs the question of how vital salt was in the diets of indigenous people before contact. For example, the Yanomamo of Brazil, famed for their life-long low sodium diet, are known to be able to live on 50 mg of salt per day, equivalent to the salt that occurs naturally in a 3.5 oz. of piece of venison (for comparison, a teaspoon of table salt is about 2,300 mg). It may be that there is not one simple answer - the need for salt, and reasons for procuring it, undoubtedly varied through time and between groups of people.</p>
					
				  <h3 id="section-two">Making Salt </h3>
					
				  <p>Salt can be extracted from hard rock deposits, oceans and saline springs, salt-laden sediment, and even from plants which grow in salty soils or are irrigated with salt water. Salt that occurs in solid formations—massifs, salt domes, or thick layers on lake beds or buried within other geologic formations—are extracted by cutting, scraping, or shoveling. The mined salt can be processed further to remove unwanted minerals or clay, or to change its texture. </p>
					
				  <p>Leaching, or lixiviation, is the process of creating brine by saturating and straining salty, alkaline sediment. This is done on a small scale, using tools such as baskets, and on a larger scale, using elevated, layered, filtering systems and large catchments, like hollowed out tree trunks. The resulting brine can then used without further processing to cook food in. For storage and transport, however, the water must be removed. Two methods of reducing brine are solar evaporation (sometimes referred to as sal solar), and heating or cooking with fire (sal cocida). Both methods concentrate the salts, and both methods were used around the world, usually with pottery vessels specially designed for these tasks.</p>
					
				  <p>In Mesoamerica, where salt making has a long tradition, sal solar and sal cocida have been found at inland and coastal sites. The inland mountain site of El Salado (meaning “salty”) in Veracruz, Mexico, has evidence of both methods. There, salt makers used pottery trays for sal solar and collared jars for sal cocida. The resulting concentrate, often reduced to the point of being a slush or paste, was transferred to shallow basins for final shaping and drying. In the central basin of Mexico, mounds of sediment, tailings of alkaline soils leached of their salts, and huge quantities of pot sherds are evidence of salt works. Discarded ceramics associated with the mounds may have been used to process salt or as vessels for exchange and transport of salt. Not only are mounds of leached dirt typical at some Mesoamerican salt works, but ditches or canals, wells, dikes, and earthen pans for collection and/or evaporation of water might be found, depending on the method of salt production at a given locale.</p>
					
				  <p>In the Eastern Woodlands of North America, people obtained salt from saline springs, or licks. When the licks were dry, people gathered the soil from the spring area in baskets, saturated it, and filtered the brine into ceramic basins. They reduced the resulting brine into a cake of salt through either stone-boiling, cooking over a fire, or solar evaporation. Much fuel was required to reduce brine in this way. Eastern Woodland people made salt at their homesteads or at specialized salt works away from residences. They made and used at least two forms of pottery for salt production; salt vessels common in the Midwest and central Mississippi Valley were undecorated or fabric impressed thick, flat or basin-shaped saltpans (circular or rectangular), while in the deep South and in eastern Texas, thin-walled bowls and jars were often used, though salt pans were also found at residential salt making sites in this region. Ceramic pedestals may have been used to support the bowls and jars over a heating element. </p>

						<h3>Salt from Plants and Animals, and Mineral Complexity </h3>
						
						<p>. Indigenous people around the world have struck upon ways to obtain salt from non-geologic and aquatic sources, that is, from plants and animals that are particularly salty, or can be manipulated to be salty. Some plants have high salt content, such as many that grow in salt marshes or oceans. Some of these were used fresh, or dried, fried or burned before being consumed. Seaweeds and marine algae are obvious salty botanical additions to the diet, but terrestrial plants can also take in salts from the soil, and were sometimes used as a salt condiment as well. There are accounts of people irrigating plants with brine to increase their salt content, or soaking plants in brine after harvesting them, then drying them and scraping off the salt crystals. Probably more common was burning plants, reducing them to a mineral-rich salty ash that could be used in cooking. For example, the Hopi burned and consumed Atriplex cansens (four-wing saltbush) as a salt substitute and used it for nixtamalization of maize. There are also accounts of salt laden plants being burned, the ash mixed with water to dissolve the salts, and the resulting brine reduced. Dried fish eggs were used as a salty seasoning in parts of North America as well. </p>
						
						<p>Today, the salt most of us eat is highly refined, comprised of almost pure sodium and chloride. Before industrial refinement, the salt people ate contained a variety of minerals, be it from the geological source or the from secondary salt sources like plant ash. In a study comparing the mineral composition of modern refined salts, commercial specialty salts (such as sea salt), plant derived salts, and indigenous North American geologic salts, Harriet Kuhnlein found that the plant ash samples had more essential minerals, especially calcium, potassium, and iron, than the other sources, as well as other higher levels of nonessential minerals, including lead. The commercial refined salts had the least mineral complexity, as expected. In other words, there are nutritional values (and potential hazards) of indigenous and plant derived salts beyond sodium and chloride elements.  </p>
					</div>
					<h3 id="section-three">Archeological Signature of Salt</h3>
					
					<p>Because the mineral dissolves in water, tracing salt in the archeological record is notoriously difficult. Archeological salt specimens are found rarely, and only at sites with exceptional preservation. Mesa Verde, the spectacular cliff dwelling site in Colorado, is one such place. There, salt was found in different forms: loose within a prairie dog skin pouch stitched with yucca fibers, shaped like a flattened circular cake inside a lidded Mesa Verde Black-on-White olla (jar), and two conical salt cakes. Stuart Baldwin, the reporting archeologist, conducted chemical analyses of these specimens and determined that they were from unknown salt sources, not local to Mesa Verde. </p>
					
					<p>Indigenous tools for mining hard rock salt have been found in tunnels in the western United States, where large scale mining yielded enough salt for use by local populations as well as for trade. At the Pueblo Grande de Nevada (Lost City) salt caves in southern Nevada, for example, salt was mined with grooved mauls hafted onto wood shafts. In Arizona at Verde Valle, hafted and unhafted stone picks, a wood club, cedar bark torches, and a possible digging stick, among other tools, were found within ancient salt mines.</p>

						</a>

					</figure>
					
					<p>Most salt making sites are open air, and so the archeologist must look for durable signs of salt production rather than the salt itself. Hearth features used to reduce brine and large volumes of broken pottery used to prepare or store salt are the most widely recognized markers of salt making, globally. Industrial scale indigenous salt works typically have an enormous amount of broken utilitarian pottery, called briquetage. This coarse pottery, used in reduction of saline, was likely broken by use and heat stress, or was broken intentionally by the salt maker to remove the hardened cake within. Simple pedestals of clay or rocks, used to support vessels over a fire when reducing brine, are sometimes found in association with briquetage, though broken pot sherds may also have been used as pedestals. Where brine was reduced by cooking, remnants of hearths are expected. Large areas of burned soils, ash, and burned rocks (if they were used as pit linings and heating elements) are found at such sites. However, hearths and ovens were used for a wide variety of processes, and so briquetage is the arguably the most diagnostic attribute of an indigenous salt work. </p>
					
					<p>Most pottery in North America dates to the Late Prehistoric and post-contact periods, and so our archeological knowledge of indigenous salt making and use is biased towards these periods. Relatively little is known about salt procurement during the Archaic and Paleoindian periods. Though the western United States contains some of the most accessible salt deposits in the form of salt playas and hard rock salt mines, the best studied salt making sites in North American are salines in the Eastern Woodlands, which have abundant evidence of the intensive salt making through reduction of brine.</p>
