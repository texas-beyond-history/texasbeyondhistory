    <td width="480" height="3374" valign="top"><p>The Horn Shelter exhibit was written by <strong>Susan Dial</strong> and <strong>Albert Redder,</strong> based on Redder's work and that of <strong>Frank Watt</strong>, &nbsp;<strong>Diane  Young Holliday</strong> and others referenced below.  Dial interviewed Redder  on numerous occasions, examined the artifacts, and added new research findings and previously unpublished imagery  to create this exhibit.    <strong>Dee Ann Story </strong>served as reviewer for this online project, providing critical insights based on her previous synthesis of findings from the Horn Shelter site and others in the region. <strong>Ken Brown</strong> also served as a review editor for the exhibit,   offering numerous suggestions informed by his research.</p>
      <p><strong>Heather Smith</strong> developed the exhibit for the web and created the artistic collages. Artist and archeologist <strong>Frank  Weir </strong>painted the scene of the Paleoindian burial at Horn Shelter. <strong>LaVern Dutton</strong> and <strong>George Larson </strong>of the Bosque Museum  in Clifton also  helped make the exhibit possible, contributing photographs, information, and  assistance. Photographs were also provided by <strong>Calvin Smith</strong> of the Western Heritage Museum, and the <strong>Mayborn Museum</strong> of Baylor University. </p>
      <p>The exhibit was funded through donations from the <strong>William P. Clements Foundation, </strong><strong>Dr. and Mrs. Warren Whitlow</strong> of Dallas, the <strong>Council of Texas Archeologists,</strong> <strong>Texas</strong><strong> Archeological Society</strong>, <strong>Friends of TARL</strong>, and  individual TBH supporters. </p>

      <p>Albert Redder traces his interest in archeology  to  childhood, when his mother brought him an arrowhead from one of the fields on the family's Knox County ranch near Seymour, Texas. &quot;After that, I was hooked,&quot; he recalls. Even while serving in the Army in France during World War II, Redder kept a watchful eye   for artifacts while digging slit trenches or walking patrol. Returning to Waco, he joined the Texas Archeological Society in the early 1950s and began attending the organization's meetings and field schools.  &quot;I began to realize just how much information was being lost when artifacts and their provenience were not carefully documented.&quot; An active member of the Central Texas Archeological Society,  he served as president, field coordinator, and an outreach speaker. In 1988, Redder was named a Fellow of the Texas Archeological Society (TAS), in recognition of his efforts in the field and, in particular, his decades of work at Horn Shelter. </p>
      <p>Frank Watt&nbsp; was a principal founder of the Central Texas Archeological Society in 1934. A prodigious avocational archeologist, researcher, and writer, Watt served as editor and publisher of the society's bulletin, <em>Central Texas Archeologist</em>, and contributed articles on his fieldwork and analyses in numerous other journals and publications. A member of the TAS since 1938, he served a a regional vice president and trustee, and was elected as Fellow of the organization in 1976. Following his death in 1981, a special issue of the CTA bulletin was written in his honor. This 1985 issue includes Redder's first article on Horn Shelter and  tributes to Watt's work. </p>
      <p>Diane Young  Holliday first met Texas  archeologists as an Earthwatch volunteer working with the Texas A &amp; M  field school at a Mimbres pueblo.&nbsp; She  followed the Aggies back to College    Station and began a new life and career.&nbsp; Under the direction of Dr. Gentry Steele, she  analyzed the Horn Shelter human remains for her Master&rsquo;s thesis and published  aspects of the study in the <em>Central Texas Archeologist</em>, <em>Current  Research in the Pleistocene</em>, and <em>Plains Anthropologist</em>.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Dee Ann Story is Professor Emeritus of Anthropology at the University of Texas at Austin and former Director of the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory. She has been a content contributor and reviewer for numerous exhibits on TBH and is a longtime supporter. Her 1990 overview of native peoples of the Gulf Coastal Plain includes a synthesis of Horn Shelter, based on her discussions with Albert Redder and examination of some of the materials.</p>
      <p>Ken Brown is a Research Fellow at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory and he has worked in the   field for nearly 40 years. Ken's Ph.D. dissertation on the <A href="../st-plains/images/ap5.html" target="_blank">Berger Bluff </A>site provides   unique insight into the Late Pleistocene and Early Holocene climatic history of   the coastal plains of Texas. </p><br>
